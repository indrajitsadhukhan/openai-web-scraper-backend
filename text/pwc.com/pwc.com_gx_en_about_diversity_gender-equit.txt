The path to continued progress









At PwC, supporting balanced gender representation across our business has long been a focus. But we still have more we want to do. We are laser focused on the representation of women at leadership levels combined with substantive action that drives an inclusive talent culture from day one. This dual approach supports a sustainable pipeline of female talent across our network.

We ask each member firm in our network to explicitly focus on gender diversity. To increase accountability, we have developed several gender-focused KPI’s including women partner admissions, proportionality of promotions, women experienced hires, the representation of women in succession planning and women leading priority accounts. Looking forward, we’re committed to continued progress and support of gender equity.

Leadership commitment
Each member firm in the PwC network is focusing on gender equity as a part of its local I&D strategy and action plan, supported by both its Territory Senior Partner and Territory Inclusion Leader. Beyond that commitment, our Global I&D Council views gender equity as a priority area and is looking across five metrics to see that progress continues. We know actions start at the top, and have put the people and processes in place to drive continued support of gender equity across our network.








Leadership representation






Leadership representation
To increase representation of women in leadership positions, we are working with member firms to review and strengthen their approach to attracting, developing and progressing women in senior roles and partner admissions. Additionally, at a global level, we apply a gender lens to all network-level succession planning and leadership appointment activity. Finally, to help our people see themselves at all levels of our organisation, we continue to increase the number of visible women role models at senior levels providing venues for them to share their professional and personal experiences.








Attraction and advancement






Attraction and advancement
We are focused on supporting equal levels of female representation throughout our pipeline. To help support this, we are working towards hiring more experienced women, particularly at senior manager and director level grades, and we’re placing a strong focus on promotions. Two of our five gender KPIs focus on experienced recruitment and promotions to help increase accountability. Ultimately, these initiatives will support gender parity across all levels of our organisation and areas of our business.








Data driven approach






Data driven approach
As the only dimension of diversity that can be measured globally, we have a unique opportunity to take a business-led approach to addressing gender diversity. We can better understand our realities, challenges and opportunities through real-time and predictive data-powered insights to create change. This is fundamental to achieving and measuring progress, identifying critical interventions and driving leadership accountability.


























International Women’s Day 2023: Empowering Women









For International Women’s Day (IWD) 2023, PwC is sharing the voices of women from around the world through our research-based insights on empowerment – and exploring what more can be done to propel women’s empowerment in the workplace, the economy, and the technology sector.
This year's UN Women IWD theme is ‘DigitALL: innovation and technology for gender equality’. We take a look inside PwC bringing together profiles of what it’s like to work and lead in technology from our PwC women in tech role models, and some of the programmes we’ve put in place to support balanced gender representation in our digital and technology practices.
