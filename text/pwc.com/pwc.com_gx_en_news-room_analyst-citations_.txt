PwC has been named as a Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Cloud Professional Services 2022 Vendor Assessment (April 2022, IDC #US48061322).  
According to the report, “Cloud professional services providers continue to expand capabilities, including through acquisition, to complement their traditional strengths. At this point, almost every historically technical consultancy can point to bona fide business consultants and strategists on staff, while the once "pure" strategy firms have deep cloud implementation experience.”
The author of this IDC MarketScape report, Gard Little, says that: “When buyers were asked what characteristics are required for any cloud professional services vendor to be successful at a worldwide level, the most frequently mentioned attributes were "provide an appropriate and high-quality team for the project" and "provide technical insights and competence."
The IDC MarketScape report states that, “Since it began investing in its cloud business in 2007, PwC's cloud professional services strategy has remained constant — embed cloud engineering and innovation capabilities across service lines in support of business transformation. While continuing to evolve and sharpen its strategy, PwC remains committed to delivering clients end-to-end professional services, from helping them reinvent their business model in the cloud to building solutions that power new ways of working every day. PwC's ability to deliver distinctive outcomes is underpinned by the company's understanding of industries, after almost a decade in a sector-oriented operating model, as well as expertise in the full range of business functions, and the technical skills required to build sophisticated, cloud-powered business solutions.” 
Commenting on PwC’s strengths, the report states that, “PwC's strengths include the company's pricing model and cost management strategies, as well as its growth and employee strategies, and the functionality delivered and its customer service capabilities. As part of a migration and transformation from a legacy datacenter landscape to the cloud, one client summarized, "PwC was the partner supporting integration of [recently acquired firm with existing firm]. Our project team was involved there, so they were a logical choice. We did an RFP anyway. PwC was really the most tech savvy, bringing a good mix of tech, cloud, and consulting expertise."
Another client said PwC had a "genuine interest in understanding our current business model. Not a one-size-fits-all approach, they try to understand what we are trying to achieve, and understand the nuances of [client], what is relevant to us in undertaking work. Effective at leveraging offshore in India, but also brought in global experience."
Furthermore, the IDC MarketScape report says to consider PwC when, “The idea of a people- and business-led technology-enabled transformation sounds like the right approach as compared with a technology-led business transformation. PwC's approach to cloud is about solving business problems in a way that they are supported and enabled by technology, but not driven by technology alone.”
Cenk Ozdemir, Partner, Cloud and Digital Platform Lead, PwC US, said: “We are pleased and honored to be recognized by IDC as a leader in the Worldwide Professional Cloud Services 2022 MarketScape. We help our clients to accelerate their business outcomes powered by the cloud by being a trusted digital business partner every step of the way. Your cloud journey involves more than just evolving your IT. It’s about transforming your business—everything from your technology, to your processes, to your people. Designed to enable innovation that creates new business models and amazing customer experiences, our cloud transformation solutions are human-led and tech-powered—helping you drive revenue for your business while managing risk and building resilience.”
