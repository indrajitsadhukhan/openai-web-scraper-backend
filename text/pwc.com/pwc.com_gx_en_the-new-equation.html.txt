                        Innovative mindsets and smart technologies combine with fresh, diverse perspectives to move beyond the tried and tested.

                              Nothing is simple in our world today. The guiding principles that used to make sense have shifted – and opportunities and challenges can now switch in the blink of an eye. When the rules of the game are no longer obvious, you need to see beyond today to deliver outcomes that continue to create value for you, your people, your stakeholders and the communities where you live and work.

Building trust for lasting impact on business and society.
Trust has never been more important. It's the link that connects your organisation, your people, your customers, your stakeholders and the world. We know that trust isn't something you can buy off the shelf. We work to earn and grow trust through every interaction, every experience and every relationship. Every day.





Case study
Becoming Fit for Purpose
The Peel Regional Police in Ontario, Canada was dealing with what many law enforcement departments face - they were structured in a way that didn’t always make sense for the problems they were trying to solve.  The Chief wanted to take down barriers for his staff, instead of creating them.  The police service needed to relook at their vision and operations to determine top priorities, including improved on-the-job technology, strategic innovation and community policing initiatives that build trust and relationships.

Case study
Tracking your Environmental Footprint
We all have a part to play in reducing our carbon footprint.  But how do we know what kind of footprint we’re leaving behind? And what options do we have to reduce our impact?  It’s not just something that individuals must think about. These are questions for all types of businesses and communities.

Case study
Transforming Global Shipping
90% of the world’s traded goods travel by ship. However, the global shipping industry faces difficulties like congestion and container shortages. A global data platform powered by blockchain could help. But first, antitrust and regulatory hurdles would have to be cleared in each of the many jurisdictions involved.
