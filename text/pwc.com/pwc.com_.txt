Trust




Becoming fit for purpose

The Peel Regional Police in Ontario, Canada, was dealing with what many law enforcement departments face: it was structured in a way that didn’t always make sense for the problems it was trying to solve.

Transforming global shipping

Ninety percent of the world’s traded goods travel by ship. However, the global shipping industry faces difficulties such as congestion and container shortages. A global data platform powered by blockchain could help. But first, antitrust and regulatory hurdles would have to be cleared in each of the many jurisdictions involved.
