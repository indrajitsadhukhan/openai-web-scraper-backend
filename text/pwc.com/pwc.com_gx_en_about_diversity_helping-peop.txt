Transcript:
Winand Doerga, Senior Manager, PwC Netherlands:
I’m Winand Doerga and this is my 14th year with PwC. I really like the diversity in cultures and people that I learn a lot from.
Malek Aqlan, Associate, PwC Netherlands:
I’m Malek Aqlan. I’m originally from Yemen. I work as an associate within the Assurance business unit at the Rotterdam office.
Winand Doerga, Senior Manager, PwC Netherlands:
This past year I was a coach with Seeds of PwC. And I coached Malek. I mentored him and made him feel at home within our organisation. What I’ve learned is that the seeds are talented people with real talents. But they need a safe environment to grow in and I’ve learned to offer them this safe environment, to lower barriers and empower people.
Malek Aqlan, Associate, PwC Netherlands:
My traineeship at PwC was such a great experience. I felt so welcomed and supported by all the colleagues I worked with. We had a safe environment to grow, learn and be who you really are.
Winand Doerga, Senior Manager, PwC Netherlands:
My most memorable experience was during a meeting when Malek felt comfortable enough to talk to partners and share his opinion and vision. When he entered PwC he was a bit more reserved. He didn’t really feel free. It was my job as a coach to empower him so he’d feel comfortable within PwC, so he could show his qualities to others.
Malek Aqlan, Associate, PwC Netherlands:
My most valuable experience during the traineeship was to work and meet with very diverse team members where I was introduced to new ideas and to new cultures that I never knew before. That was in itself a great experience in my life. My coach Winand helped me to overcome a very significant development point in my life, which is being afraid to participate in groups and share my opinions and experiences with others.
Winand Doerga, Senior Manager, PwC Netherlands:
I grew as a person because it has shown me that having a safe environment in which you can develop and grow is not always obvious. Malek told me about his background in a war zone. Despite his qualities and training he was unable to create a proper future. It gave me a broader scope on the world and showed me that what we have here is not common-place and should be cherished. And it made me realise that many people don’t get the same opportunities as us. PwC is contributing towards offering these people a chance.
Malek Aqlan, Associate, PwC Netherlands:
That’s the most significant point with Winand. He helped me to be who you really are and don’t be afraid to share your opinions.
