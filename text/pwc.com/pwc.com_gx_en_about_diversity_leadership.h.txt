Accountability. We hold our leaders, ourselves and our member firms responsible for change. 
Leadership commitment, accountability and transparency are fundamental to driving the Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) progress and demonstrating that we are action and impact focused to our people and our stakeholders at PwC.
We do this by fostering a culture of leadership commitment and accountability driven via our Global I&D council and Territory Inclusion Leaders, Member Firm Leadership engagement and accountability, seven well-defined I&D KPIs and a commitment to greater levels of transparency to support accelerated and sustained progress. 
Leadership commitment  
Our Global I&D Council, formed by our Global Chairman, is made up of ten senior leaders from across the PwC Network. The Council’s purpose is to elevate and advocate for I&D across the PwC Network, make sure that perspectives from across the Network shape our direction, and build momentum to help accelerate global and local change. Chaired, supported and facilitated by Bob Moritz, our Global Chairman, the Council members work with the top levels of leadership in our Member Firms to make sure they are setting concrete strategies around I&D and are held accountable for their progress. 
We reinforce the actions and commitment of our Global I&D Council at the local level through our Territory Inclusion Leaders (TIL’s). Each PwC Member Firm has an appointed TIL, who is an influential leader with responsibility for local I&D strategies and implementing the necessary actions required to build a stronger culture of belonging for our community of solvers. The TIL works hand in hand with their local leadership team to deliver an I&D action plan that enables PwC’s The New Equation business strategy and fosters meaningful change locally.
The Global I&D Council, the strategy council Territory Inclusion Leaders and our Global I&D team make up our collective Global I&D Leadership Team.  
Greater levels of transparency
Our work on leadership commitment and accountability is further underpinned through our focus on greater levels of internal and external transparency.  As part of our commitment to promoting transparent reporting, we are actively focused on publishing key diversity disclosures aligned with the World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and broader female representation disclosures annually via our Global Annual Review.
