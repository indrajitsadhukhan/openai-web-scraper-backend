Using your browser to control cookies

Some of the third parties that collect information from or about you on PwC sites or apps may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) self-regulatory program. To make choices about the use of information from or about you for online behavioral or interest-based advertising on websites (desktop and mobile browsers), please visit the DAA, and within mobile applications, you can download the DAA’s AppChoices application from your mobile device at www.aboutads.info/appchoices or from your device’s app store.
Use of cookies by PwC US
Below is a detailed list of the cookies we use on this website. Our website is scanned with our cookie scanning tool regularly to keep the list updated. We classify the use of cookies into four main categories: (1) necessary; (2) analytical/performance; (3) functionality; and (4) marketing. You can find more information about each category in the relevant sections below. We also provide information on the type of cookie (first v. third party) and the lifespan of the cookie (session v. persistent). Please note:

‘First party’ cookies are directly stored by the website (or domain) you visit. These cookies allow website owners to collect analytics data, remember language settings, and perform other useful functions that provide a good user experience.



‘Third party’ cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for analytics and/or online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server’s code.

‘Session’ cookies remain in your browser during your browser session only, i.e. until you leave the website.

‘Persistent’ cookies remain in your browser after the session (unless deleted by you).
