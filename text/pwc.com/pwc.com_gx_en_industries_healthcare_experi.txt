Deals and corporate finance/funding
Budgetary pressures are forcing cuts to funding and driving down margins in mature markets, limiting growth. Meanwhile, companies in emerging markets are becoming more sophisticated and improving scale, lowering risks for possible mergers & acquisitions. PwC engages with clients in evaluating buy and sell side strategy and assisting with pre-deal financial, IT and operations due diligence, valuation and post-deal integration and divestiture services.
Contact us, we can help you.



































Digital health
Technology and analytics is helping to transform the healthcare industry. Digitally enabled care is no longer a ‘nice-to-have’, it’s a business imperative and systems interact with one another to make informed decisions about the delivery of care. PwC can work with organisations to ensure systems provide end-to-end delivery – from IT strategy to implementation.

Economics
Economics is playing an increasing role in shaping the direction of healthcare policy. In most health systems, economics is used to answer questions about efficiency and value for money in the way healthcare resources are allocated. PwC can assist with strategy, economic regulation, and growth strategies, as well as manage the impact of changes in commissioning patterns and local markets.
Contact us, we can help you.


























Hospital efficiency

Competition is relentless and pressing. So are the demands from all quarters that require providers to deliver better care for less money. PwC can help clients assess their structure, processes, rewards, metrics and talent to help optimise hospital labour, reduce costs and increase quality.
Contact us, we can help you.

Contact us, we can help you.

We also help with strategies, practices and technology tools to quantify damages and reduce the cost of disputes.
Contact us, we can help you.

By aligning incentives between payers and providers, PwC can help design and implement effective integrated care pathways that leads to improved efficiency, reduced costs and better health outcomes.
Contact us, we can help you.

People and organisation

One of the biggest challenges facing any industry going through change - and this is especially true within healthcare - is acquiring and retaining talent. We can help clients with the technical and organisational issues that shape HR structure, improve the performance of their workforce, and manage their human capital risks.
Contact us, we can help you.

















Public policy
PwC works with clients to help develop and implement strategies that engage government officials and others who influence public policy. Our approach emphasises on continual outreach and developing relationships with key decision makers at all levels of government with a broad range of interested stakeholders.
Contact us, we can help you.



































Public-Private Partnerships

While the provision of health is widely recognised as the responsibility of government, private capital and expertise are increasingly viewed as welcome sources to induce efficiency and innovation. PwC’s international network and our specialist focus on PPPs means that we can bring locally-based experience and international expertise together effectively.
Contact us, we can help you.

















Quality and safety services

Governments and organisations are facing growing pressure to reduce costs without impacting quality, safety, and access to care. PwC can help clients adapt their services and processes to drive greater cooperation among caregivers, providers and payers and encourage better outcomes with less risk of losing reimbursement.
Contact us, we can help you.



































Health systems reform

Health reform efforts are changing the playing field, creating greater accountability for quality, promoting new care models, and offering new incentives. PwC’s integrated teams, comprised of global, regional and local practitioners, can help guide governments and organisations with healthcare regulation and reform as well as explain the financial implications of new health provisions.
Contact us, we can help you.


























Regulatory services

The healthcare environment is becoming increasingly complicated with expanded mandatory compliance programmes, regulatory audits that are growing more intense, the use of data and analytics to ensure enforcement and more corrective actions, fines and sanctions. PwC has extensive experience in helping companies assess regulatory compliance, risk and their compliance programme governance and structure.
Contact us, we can help you.

Security and privacy services

Healthcare companies need to manage massive quantities of data, from patient medical records to complicated rules for reimbursement. PwC can help companies secure this data through attack and penetration reviews and privacy/security risk assessments. PwC can also assess, recommend, design and test clients’ processes, systems and controls for compliance with applicable security and privacy laws.
Contact us, we can help you.

















Strategy
The new health economy is disrupting traditional roles, prompting companies to consider new business models. New entrants, which are defined as disruptive, recent arrivals to the health market, are coming from sectors such as telecommunications, technology and retail. They are redefining the industry for consumers, providers, payers and investors in both developed and emerging nations.
We help non-traditional healthcare companies develop new, high impact health products and services, and help traditional healthcare companies adopt and leverage relevant concepts from other industries. We are well positioned to help determine where to play, how to play, and what you can win in a shifting healthcare ecosystem. PwC can design and execute a sustainable business model that controls costs, defines product value, capitalises on technology and better aligns incentives, partnerships and deals.
Contact us, we can help you.

Complying with and responding to inquiries from tax authorities, globally; and

Emerging trends in healthcare
Significant disruptive trends are reshaping the world and revolutionising the health industry today. As a result, new business models are emerging, roles are shifting and incumbents are being supplanted by new players. These issues have always been prevalent but they’re becoming more pronounced as economic and geopolitical forces collide to create a more dynamic and competitive marketplace.
