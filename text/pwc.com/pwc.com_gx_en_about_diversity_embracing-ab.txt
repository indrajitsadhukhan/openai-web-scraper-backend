PwC Germany’s myAbility Talent Programme goes the extra mile to support students with visible and invisible disabilities, helping them gain access to the labour market and jumpstart their professional lives.



















myAbility Talent Programme
Looking for a job is never easy, but the challenges can multiply for the 9.4%1 of the German population living with a disability.
Despite today’s hiring crisis, people with disabilities have a greater tendency to be both unemployed and under-employed. Statistics indicate only 57%2 of people with disabilities between the ages of 15 and 64 were integrated into the German labour market or looking for work in 2019. For people without disabilities in the same age group, the share is 82%.3
In an effort to broaden its talent pool, help improve employment equity for people with disabilities and better understand the needs of people with disabilities, PwC Germany has been partnering with the myAbility Talent Programme since its introduction in 2019. The programme also aims to reduce the potential impact of unconscious bias and identify areas for improvement around accessibility and awareness at the firm.
The myAbility Talent Programme supports students with visible and invisible disabilities (such as chronic and mental illnesses) through one-on-one coaching, networking and job shadowing, making it easier for them to get access to the German labour market and start their professional life. The programme is aimed at individuals with disabilities and chronic health conditions who are nearing the end of their bachelor's degree, are in a master's programme or have completed their degree within the last five years. By helping employers and the participants share day-to-day work experiences, the programme opens the door to a rich source of talent and diversity that benefit both individuals and the workplace overall. 
People with disabilities and chronic illnesses are often overlooked and their contributions under-leveraged. Research4 shows organisations that employ people with disabilities have greater retention, reliability and punctuality, employee loyalty, inclusive work culture and enhanced company image. PwC is committed to helping remove obstacles those with disabilities face when seeking employment. This creates greater opportunity for people with disabilities, increases the awareness within the organisation and delivers on their goal of creating a more inclusive workplace environment for people of all abilities.





















“The job shadowing has given a whole new perspective and made it clear that we live in an ableist world that we need to constantly challenge in order to achieve equity.”
Katharina Schwarzkopf


























The Results

15+ job shadowing assignments completed.
Eight workshops hosted to understand better the needs of persons with disabilities.
One “How to Increase Accessibility” article published.
Additionally, the myAbility Talent Programme is planning to transform from pure job shadowing into an internship programme in the future.
