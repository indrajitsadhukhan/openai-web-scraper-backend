UiPath’s Enterprise Automation Platform with PwC’s Intelligent Automation (IA) Experience
The New Equation is a future that is human-led and tech-enabled. It will be powered by tools that enable people to discover automation opportunities, build and manage automated solutions while they undertake their automation journey from strategy to execution.
While automation is high on the agenda across industries, PwC and UiPath have come together to combine PwC’s robotic process automation consulting and domain expertise with UiPath’s platform capabilities to drive the automation agenda for our customers.
UiPath’s enterprise platform, combined with PwC’s digital transformation experience and global market reach, can help organisations deliver faster, more intelligent and better outcomes while building trust across the value chain.Together, PwC and UiPath automation work to deliver more value for organisations through a robust portfolio of automation solutions that can provide immediate impact for the enterprise.





























Augmenting cognitive technologies with RPA successfully has always been a challenge for most organisations. I am delighted that we have been awarded the UiPath Excellence award in the category of "Best Cognitive Automation". This is a testimony to how we, at PwC, are creating innovative solutions for ourselves and for our clients, leveraging various automation tools and technologies

Value realisation framework
Digitisation today is not just an option for companies but critical for them to be competitive and growing in the market. Emerging technologies, growing amounts of data and smarter ways of getting insights are changing the way customers, businesses and regulators interact. Amidst this race to thrive in the digital revolution, automation has become a crucial growth lever. However, following operating constraints and situational needs hinder the digital transformation journey:

Complex landscape and critical nature of functions with interlinkages between processes and systems 
Large scale data under processing to be able to generate meaningful outcomes with semi-structured and unstructured format of data. 
Tight turnaround times in specific situations 
Human interventions are required because of complex rules and correlations
Lack of understanding of capabilities of available technologies and the art of possible leveraging the same












Solution
The Value realisation framework,  leverages on complete capabilities of UiPath enterprise platforms along with complementary technologies to cater to business goals across industry / sector. 
In this value realisation framework, UiPath capabilities are used to integrate with core applications through APIs and Core IT services for data extraction. Deep insights are created by analytics and data visualisation layer. The business user can access these insights through the Conversational AI. The entire experience is enhanced through the Digital Adoption platform. 










Benefits of this framework are:















Automatic data retrieval from different systems, removing manual data entry



 









Enables data driven decision making, by providing enhanced insights




 









Enables retrieval of specific data points and reports on an as-needed basis




 









Automatically generates and sends reports, reducing time spent on manual data manipulation




 









Inbuilt automation governance and controls along with technology adoption metrics




 












How PwC and UiPath empower the future of work
Organisations around the world are seeking to transform how they operate. PwC and UiPath are helping to lead the way. We leverage UiPath platform components like process mining, document understanding and AI center to help organisations transition from traditional RPA to Enterprise Automation. PwC has also built assets and frameworks to bring in Scale@Speed.
Digital upskilling is critical to building the workforce of tomorrow, today. Human capital that does not evolve could very soon turn into a liability. Considering this fact, organisations are adopting citizen-led automation. The low code/no  code capability of UiPath Enterprise Platform is helping people across organisations transform themselves, bringing in value and operational efficiencies within our firm – and to our clients.
PwC from its vast experience of executing global transformation projects, develops and executes client customised digital transformation strategy along with UiPath’s Enterprise Platform. These solutions are designed to drive efficiencies by automating time-consuming tasks and freeing time for value-added activities that benefit both individuals and the enterprise.
