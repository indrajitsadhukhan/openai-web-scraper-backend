Today, leaders are asked to lead in a world that is unlike anything anyone has ever experienced. As is described in PwC’s ADAPT framework, the world is facing significant and increasingly urgent challenges that are affecting individuals, organisations, governments and society alike. 
These trends are coming fast and are impacting decision making today. One thing is clear, the need for a new form of leadership has never been more critical.
There are six paradoxes which are becoming increasingly important for leaders to navigate. These are not the only paradoxes leaders face, but the ones most urgent in today’s context and will remain important in the future. The paradoxes should be considered as a system; they impact each other and all need to be balanced simultaneously. To truly differentiate yourself as a leader, learning how to comfortably inhabit both elements of each paradox will be critical to your success.

Blair Sheppard, Global Leader, Strategy and Leadership for the PwC network discusses the Six paradoxes of leadership for a changing world

























Six paradoxes of leadership defined









 Globally minded: to be agnostic about belief system and market structure and be a student of the world.
Localist: to be fully committed to the success of a  local market.
 
The paradox is the need to be both deeply embedded in the local market and connected across the globe at the same time. This requires someone to be able to recognise their biases resulting from the lens through which they view the world and to learn how to operate most effectively in any locale, without compromising the success of another market in which they wish to operate. To be able to harness the power of the organisation in its largest sense to make significant and purposeful progress in unfamiliar places. This requires both global and local connectivity, and the ability to negotiate between locales to drive collective success.







Globally-minded localist

How do you navigate a world that is increasingly both global and local?






 High Integrity: to maintain integrity and build trust in all interactions.
Politician: to accrue support, negotiate, form coalitions overcome resistance to maintain progress.
 
The paradox is that in a deeply political environment, people can lose their integrity. Much time is spent meeting the needs of other people and managing the politics of getting plans to happen. Driving change is a constant state of being for leaders, but change affects the balance of power and creates a scenario in which some parties feel like they are losing. In order to keep all people engaged on the optimal outcome for the organisation during times of change the integrity of the leader is even more critical. Work to reconcile the political requirements while maintaining integrity, because without integrity it is challenging to lead.







High-integrity politician

How do you navigate the politics of getting things to happen and retain your character?






 Humble: to foster deep personal resilience in self and others, recognising when they need to help and be helped.
Hero: to exude confidence, with competitive flair and gravitas. 
 
The paradox is that leaders feel like they need to behave like heros - exuding confidence in these anxiety-inducing times. But having confidence is not the same as unwillingness to change course. Leadership requires the ability to take advice from many quarters and make decisions based on a variety of inputs. Leaders need personal resilience to admit when they are wrong, allow others to make mistakes, and foster confidence throughout the organisation. To be able to make smart decisions and navigate through failure are critical opposing characteristics leaders need to possess and will enable people to experience their leaders as humans. 







Humble hero

How do you have the confidence to act in an uncertain world and the humility to recognise when you are wrong?






 Strategic: to find insights and observations by looking to the future to inform decision making today.
Executor: to deliver exquisitely on today’s challenges.
 
The paradox is that usually people have an inclination towards strategy or execution. The most powerful approach is to articulate a strategy, understand how it needs to evolve, and execute with both the immediate need and changing future in mind. Executing without strategy creates a higher probability of an even more significant crisis in the future. However, it is also ineffective to spend a disproportionate amount of time thinking about the future and missing the need to execute now. Leaders should find a way to be strategic, bring the future into the present in order to solve today’s problems with tomorrow in mind, and get it done. 







Strategic executor

How do you execute effectively while also being highly strategic?






 Tech-savvy: to drive technology enhancement which generates future success.
Humanist: to understand deeply human effectiveness in any given system.
 
The paradox is that traditionally those with technical skills were not also acquiring the skills required to understand people’s needs or how to lead them. As a result, many people who are driving technological advancement aren’t equipped to consider the human implications of their work. This is also true in reverse as those who have responsibility for people haven’t always understood the impact technology will have on their business and workforce. The leader’s role is to nurture the success of the business and, in doing so, offer a better future for their people. That means balancing being technically savvy with a focus on humanity. 







Tech-savvy humanist

How do you become increasingly tech savvy and remember that organisations are run by people, for people?





Traditioned: to connect deeply with the purpose of the original idea and bring this value to the present day.
Innovator: to drive innovation and try new things out; have the courage to fail and allow others to do so.
 
The paradox is that it is tempting to continue to execute the things you do really well, and miss the opportunities that will help you remain relevant. It requires the ability to respect the past and decide what needs to be brought forward into the future, while also having the courage to try new things. Too often innovation is considered a wholly greenfield experiment, rather than something that is incremental and builds on what already exists. It needs to be both and leaders should define when to preserve the past in moving to the future and when to create completely fresh.







Traditioned innovator

How do you use the past to help direct your future success?

“So if leaders around the world want a better future for our children and grandchildren, they need  to find within themselves the capacity to navigate the Six paradoxes or surround themselves with people who can. The stakes are simply too high for them not to.”
