Dealers and Distributors Experience Platform (D2EP)
Build a customer-centric, integrated dealer/distributor management system (DMS)















































As customer expectations evolve and cost pressures rise, manufacturers must adapt to a shift in customer expectations for a seamless and connected experience across various touchpoints. However most manufacturer/OEMs focus on CRM transformation which rarely touches dealer/distributor operations and their DMS.
Today, dealers need to not only operate like a company, but they must also offer personalised services, be more customer-focused and efficient than ever before to acquire and retain customers. With PwC’s Dealers and Distributors Experience Platform (D2EP), manufacturers can do this by integrating multiple systems into one powerful DMS integrated with CRM, sales, service, spares, inventory, finance, compliance, procurement and marketing.

Key benefits of PwC’s Dealers and Distributors Experience Platform (D2EP)















Customer 360* View
D2EP provides a 360* customer view for manufacturer and dealer/distributor and forms a stronger OEM and dealer association, which enhances sales and after-sales activities, leveraging customer analytics to create personalised marketing campaigns.




 













Robust Lead Management
Integrating CRM with DMS gives insights into lead sources that help OEMs and dealers align customer engagement strategies, and coordinate consistent sales and service communications; impacting lead acquisition, and conversion rates




 













Inventory Transparency
It allows sharing the real-time product, pricing and inventory information with dealers/distributors to provide transparency and satisfy customer expectations. It prevents revenue leakages throughout the lifecycle of sales or post-sales.




 

















Service Transformation
Make your DMS customer-centric. With D2EP, OEMs and dealers/distributors can develop advanced 'service intervention' campaigns that unify sales and service teams.




 













Integrated Marketing Channel
Helps create automated and personalised customer engagement campaigns at scale, throughout the customer lifecycle to provide transparency, trust, and customer satisfaction.




 













Dealer - OEM 360* View
A complete 360-degree dealership/distributorship view that enables faster OEM-dealer collaboration and enables dealers to create consistent and personalised customer journeys across every customer touchpoint.
