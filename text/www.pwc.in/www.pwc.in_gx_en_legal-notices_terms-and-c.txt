This statement was last updated January 25, 2021.
 
These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) apply to www.pwc.com/gx and any other PwC Website on or accessible via www.pwc.com (collectively, the “Websites”) that links to these Terms. 
The Websites are operated by certain Member Firms (described below) under the coordination of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (“PwCIL”) a private company limited by guarantee registered in England and Wales under company number 03590073 and registered office at 1 Embankment Place, London, WC2N 6RH. To contact us, please email pwcil.secretary@pwc.com. 
Some Websites and certain content may be subject to different or additional terms. By accessing any other Websites or content, you agree to be bound by any additional terms that govern use of each such Website or such content. 
Please read these Terms carefully as they contain important information regarding your legal rights, remedies and obligations with respect to your use of the Websites, including but not limited to various limitations, exclusions, and indemnities.  
By accessing or using the Websites, and the content and services available via the Websites, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms in all respects with respect to the Websites; such agreement will be deemed for all legal purposes to be in writing and legally enforceable as a signed written agreement. If you are not willing to be bound by each and every term or condition, or if any representation made herein by you is not true, you may not use, and must cease using, the Websites. 
As used in these Terms and the Websites, PwC, us, and we refer to the PwC network and/or one or more of its Member Firms. Each Member Firm in the PwC network is a separate legal entity. For further details, please see www.pwc.com/structure.  See http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/about/office-locations.html for a list of countries in which PwC Member Firms operate.



















Definitions and interpretation
For clarity and comprehension, we have defined certain words used in the Terms and on the Websites. Additional definitions are included elsewhere in the Terms.

“PwC”, “we” or “us” refer to the PwC network and/or its individual Member Firms. “PwC”, “we” or “us”, as used in individual articles and thought leadership pieces available on the Websites may, depending on context, refer to the PwC network as a collective or to individual Member Firms.
“PwC Parties” refers collectively and inclusively to the individual Member Firms of the PwC network, including their respective officers, directors, partners, principals or equivalent; personnel; affiliates; business associates; licensors; and contractors and subcontractors.
“Registered User” means a User who has registered and created an Account with PwC to access enhanced features of a Website.
“User” means all users of a Website.
“you" means you as an individual user of a Website.
In these Terms:
i. the captions and headings are for convenience only and do not constitute substantive matter and are not to be construed as interpreting the contents of these Terms, and
ii. the word "including", the word "includes" and the phrase "such as", when following a general statement or term (whether or not non-limiting language such as "without limitation" or "but not limited to" or other words of similar import are used with reference thereto), is not to be construed as limiting, and the word "or" between two or more listed matters does not imply an exclusive relationship between the matters being connected.


















About the Websites
The Websites provide information about PwC, including thought leadership and the services and products we provide. References to “the Website,” “the Websites”, and “www.pwc.com” include all software, content and features provided within the relevant Website(s). In addition, in these Terms, all references to Websites addresses or URLs will also include any successor or replacement Websites containing substantially similar information as the referenced Website(s).
The Websites offer a range of interactive features, such as access to premium and personalised content, user profiles, reading lists, commenting and other publicly accessible collaborative features. We may add other features from time to time.  Certain features are available only to Registered Users. For more information about registration, please see the Registration section of these Terms.


















Informational purposes only
The Websites and content available within them is for informational purposes only. Neither the Websites nor the content available within them constitutes professional advice, and neither should be relied upon by you or any third party, including for example to operate or promote your business, secure financing or capital in any form, obtain any regulatory or governmental approvals, or otherwise to procure services or other benefits from any entity.  Before making any decision or taking any action, you should consult with professional advisers. 


















Changes to and availability of the Websites
The Websites are made available on an “as is” basis with no representation or warranty with respect to their functionality or availability and with no guarantee that they are complete, accurate, or timely nor any guarantee regarding any results you or others may obtain from their use. Access to all or parts of any of the Websites may be suspended at any time without notice.


















Your responsibilities 
Acceptable conduct
You will use the Websites only for lawful purposes. If at any time you become aware of any violation, by any person or entity, of any part of these Terms, you will immediately notify us via this contact form and provide us with assistance, as requested, to stop or remedy such violation.
Prohibited conduct
In using the Websites, you must not do any of the following:

Post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Websites any materials that are or may be: (a) threatening, harassing, degrading, hateful or intimidating, or otherwise fail to respect the rights and dignity of others; (b) defamatory, libellous, fraudulent or otherwise tortious; (c) obscene, indecent, pornographic or otherwise objectionable; or (d) potentially harmful or invasive or intended to damage or hijack the operation of, or to monitor the use of, any hardware, software or equipment, such as a virus, worm, Trojan horse, Easter Egg, time bomb, spyware or other computer code, file or program (each, a “Virus”).
Post, transmit, or otherwise make available through the Websites any material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity or privacy or any other proprietary right, without the express prior written consent of the applicable owner.
Use the Websites for any commercial purpose or otherwise use the Websites for processing data or other information on behalf of any third party.
Use the Websites for any purpose that is fraudulent or otherwise tortious or unlawful.
Interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Websites or the servers or networks used to make the Websites available, including by hacking or defacing any portion of any of the Websites; or violate any requirement, procedure or policy of such servers or networks.
Restrict or inhibit any other person from using the Websites.
Create or share content without first obtaining any necessary permissions from third parties or otherwise use the Websites to post or transmit any information that you do not have the right to provide; that would violate any applicable law or regulation; or that would violate, infringe or misappropriate any third party right or interest. 
Reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of, sell, rent, lease, loan, timeshare, distribute or otherwise exploit any portion of (or any use of) the Websites except as expressly authorised herein, without PwC’s express prior written consent.
Reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of any of the Websites, except where such restriction is expressly permitted by applicable law.

Frame or mirror any portion of the Websites, or otherwise incorporate any portion of the Websites into any product or service, without PwC’s express prior written consent.
Systematically download and store Websites’ content. For the avoidance of doubt, caching of the Websites is permitted by a service provider acting in the normal course of its business where permitted under applicable law, such as under the UK Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002.
Use any robot, spider, Websites search/retrieval application or other manual or automatic device to (a) retrieve, index, “scrape,” “data mine” or otherwise gather content from the Websites, (b) reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Websites, or (c) harvest or collect information about users of the Websites without PwC’s express prior written consent.

If you do not comply with these Terms (or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect or are investigating suspected non-compliance), we may suspend your access to the Websites or take any other steps we consider appropriate.


















Requirements to Use the Websites 
If you are an individual, you represent and warrant that you have reached the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside, and that you are in any event at least 18 years old. 
If you are using the Websites on behalf of a corporation or other organisation, you represent and warrant that you have the ability to agree to these Terms on behalf of such organisation and all references to "you" throughout these Terms will include such organisation, jointly and severally with you personally.
You represent and warrant that you and/or the organization you are acting on behalf of: (i) are not located, organized, or resident in a country that is subject to an embargo imposed by a government, union, or an intergovernmental organisation, including without limitation the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union or any EU member state, or the United Nations, or that has been designated by such parties as a “terrorist supporting” country; (ii) are not listed on any government, union, or intergovernmental organisation list of prohibited or restricted parties; and (iii) are not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by any party described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this provision. If any applicable law, rule or regulation prohibits you to access the Websites, you may not access them. If you nevertheless access or use the Websites, you will still be bound to these Terms and shall have all the obligations, responsibilities and liabilities as if you were eligible to do so.

Features 
Certain features of the Websites are available only to Registered Users. Current examples include access to premium content, reading lists, and any on-site commenting or collaboration activities. Additional features may be made available to Registered Users over time.
How to register
To register, you will need to provide certain information about yourself and create a username and password. This combination of information (“Account”) will be your Account as a Registered User. 
Registrations may be accepted, rejected or cancelled by us at any time and for any reason.  If your registration is cancelled, you will continue to have access to the Websites; however, you will no longer have access to features available only to Registered Users.
Responsibilities of Registered Users
If you choose to register with us and become a Registered User, you agree you are solely responsible for your Account and any and all activities that occur under your Account, including all activities of any persons who gain access to your Account with or without your permission. In becoming a Registered User, you also agree to:

provide true, current, accurate and complete information about yourself as requested by us from time to time and notify us promptly of any changes to your information so that your Account information is current, complete and accurate;
maintain the confidentiality and security of your Account, including your username and password;
notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your Account, Account password, or service provided through your Account, as well as any breach of security with respect to your Account, Account password, or service provided through it; and
assist us, if and as we request, to stop or remedy any breach of security related to your Account.

Privacy of Registered Users
Our Privacy statement explains how we protect and use your personal information; the Registered User section of the Privacy statement explains additional information we collect and additional uses of information about Registered Users.  
Termination 
We may, in our sole discretion, suspend, restrict or terminate your use of the Websites (including your Account, if you are a Registered User), effective at any time, without notice to you, for any reason, including because the operation or efficiency of the Websites or our or any third party's equipment or network is impaired by your use of the Websites; we have received a third party complaint which relates to your use or misuse of the Websites; or you have been or are in breach of any term or condition of these Terms. We will have no responsibility to notify any third party, including any third party providers of services, merchandise or information, of any suspension, restriction or termination of your access to the Websites.

Except where expressly stated otherwise, all right, title, and interest in and to the Websites and all Content, source code, processes, designs, technologies, URLs, domain names, marks, and logos forming any part of the Websites (collectively, "Our Content") are (a) fully vested in us, our licensors, or our suppliers and (b) protected by applicable copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, database rights, or other proprietary rights and laws. 
You agree that access and use of Our Content is subject to these Terms, including the disclaimers and limitations of liability herein. Nothing in your use of the Websites or these Terms grants you any right, title or interest in or to Our Content except the limited right to use the Websites as set out in these Terms.

copy, modify, deep link, rent, lease, loan, sell, assign, sublicense, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer any right or interest in Our Content;
remove any proprietary notices or labels on or in Our Content; or
allow any other person or entity to engage in any of the foregoing.

Your Content
The Websites may contain functionality that permits you to comment on articles; share materials; provide ideas, proposals, suggestions (“Feedback”); or otherwise make available certain materials through or in connection with your use of the Websites (collectively, “Submissions”).
If you choose to make publicly available any of your personal information or other information through the Websites (for example through posting a comment or other form of Submission), you do so at your own risk. You will also comply with all relevant requirements set out in these Terms when making a Submission.
You acknowledge and agree that your Submissions are not confidential; that your provision of Submissions is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction; and that the provision of any Submission does not place PwC under any fiduciary or other obligation.
We may (but have no obligation to) monitor, evaluate, alter or remove Submissions before or after they appear on the site; however, we have no control over and are not responsible for any use or misuse (including any distribution) by any third party of Submissions. If and when we do monitor your use of one or more of the Websites, we will do so in accordance with applicable law.
You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant the licenses referred to in these Terms. You further represent and warrant that your Submissions are (a) complete and accurate and (b) are not fraudulent, tortious, or otherwise in violation of any applicable law or any right of any third party.
