Navigate through Digital Disruptions









Digital disruptions are now the norm. Every industry and way of business are in a position of re-evaluating their market share against the backdrop of future uncertainties and possibilities. The onset of a Global Pandemic has now challenged those positions more acutely and are forcing many to adopt radical changes in their approach to the market. It is not an exaggeration to state that the solutions to many of these changes will have Public Cloud as the underlying infrastructure.
Success, therefore, often hinges on the stability and the decisions made on the cloud platforms. Never has there been a more critical time to choose partners in your cloud journey that have the depth and breadth of experience in not only the platform but the market that these platforms are expected to perform within.

Cloud Assessment, Strategy and Migration



PwC’s cloud strategy, assessment and migration is based on PwC’s transform methodology and is fully aligned with Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF). This cloud offering is designed to span across the customer's entire cloud adoption lifecycle which encompasses our 3 key offerings Cloud Strategy and Assessment, Cloud Infrastructure Setup and Migration and Managed Services. This framework consists of the following areas like assess, design, construct, implement, operate & review. Each of these areas are elucidated in detail below:

Assess Phase – This phase deals with identifying the business objectives, key drivers for cloud adoption and the business and IT challenges faced currently. A current state assessment is performed to understand the IT landscape and applications baseline from a cloud readiness perspective.
Design Phase – Cloud readiness of the applications in the IT landscape is determined using PwC’s proprietary application profiler tool. Once cloud readiness is identified, the business value of cloud is determined through TCO analysis. Other areas of cloud strategy like cloud security framework and standards, cloud adoption roadmap, operating model, governance model and DR & BCP strategy are defined in this phase
Construct Phase – In this phase, the target cloud architecture aligned with well architected framework is constructed, and azure cloud readiness guide is designed. Validation is also performed in this phase to ensure that the best practices are incorporated.
Migration Phase – This phase deals with migration workloads, expanding the blueprint according to the designed strategy. The governance and reporting structure to communicate progress is prepared as a part of this phase
Operate and review – In this phase, the setup is reviewed to ensure that expected azure environment is achieved. The other activities are ensuring best practices validation and performing testing for validation and handing over to operations/managed services team after go live.

This tried and tested methodology has been leveraged in several successful engagements for our clients. Our solutions have enabled leading companies transition on to cloud seamlessly and successfully which has given their business an edge over competitors. We at PwC, help customers in their cloud adoption journey by providing end-to-end services from cloud assessment & strategy to cloud setup & migration and managed services.

Cloud Transformation



You have already started on your cloud transformation journey, a brave and necessary step towards strengthening your security and compliance, reducing your infrastructure, and improving efficiencies and cost savings.
You are now at a critical point where you need to make sure you have the capacity and capabilities to fulfil your vision. We have been through this before and know that a key element for success is identifying and communicating a strong, defined goal to guide your cloud transformation journey. Cloud transformation is about your business and culture, not just the technology. If you are only focused on IT migration, you are missing out on a massive opportunity to drive value for your business.
Our approach will deliver on your cloud objectives because we are considered leaders in business-led transformations. We will ensure that your business outcomes are at the centre of what we do. Our approach is divided broadly across four phases namely Discovery, Prepare, Transform and Operationalise.

Discovery: Involves cloud maturity assessment, application and infrastructure discovery report, cloud regulatory support and limitations report, designing cloud migration and transformation office, gap analysis and validating the case for change
Prepare: Includes foundational checklists, landing zone design, migration plan, operating model validations and roadmap
Transform: Involves implementing the cloud operating model, launching a cloud service catalogue, automating foundational procedures, establishing operations processes, building, migrating, and integrating applications and validating migration success
Operationalise: Includes enhancing policy definitions and enforcement, enhancing monitoring and alerting capabilities, scaling training and awareness initiatives and ramping up cloud support
Construct Phase – In this phase, the target cloud architecture is constructed, landing zone and azure cloud readiness guide is designed. Validation is also performed in this phase to ensure that the best practices are incorporated
Migration Phase – This phase deals with migration workloads, expanding the blueprint according to the designed strategy. The governance and reporting structure to communicate progress is prepared as a part of this phase
Operate & review – In this phase, the setup is reviewed to ensure that expected azure environment is achieved. The other activities are ensuring best practices validation and performing testing for validation and handing over to operations/managed services team after go live

Our Collaborative Offering




Cloud accelerates the launch of new business models, deepens relationships with customers and partners, and enables migration away from legacy systems.
The rapid deployment of flexible, scalable, and elastic IT infrastructure is the “dream of the cloud.” However, the path to innovation and efficiency is often slowed by real or perceived concerns about security, regulatory compliance, and data privacy and residency.
Nearly half (48%) of organisations have a multi-cloud strategy. On average, organisations use three different cloud service providers (CSP), and 28 percent are using four or more. While using more than one CSP may be necessary and even beneficial, doing so can make security seem more challenging. Cohesive governance is key: Each CSP may have different security abilities and requirements. And frequent releases of new features and updates means that, like the clouds in the sky, your enterprise cloud environment is continually changing.
As consumption of Cloud Service Providers (CSP) continues to increase, companies must deliver sustainable performance and efficiency while simultaneously securing their assets and sensitive data. Unique security challenges exist within the Cloud environment, and effectively solving for these challenges requires a “Cloud lens” vs the traditional data center mindset.
PwC’s Cloud Risk framework can help. It involves components such as















Identity and Access Management




 









Cloud Infrastructure and platform hardening




 









Data protection and privacy




 









Network Security
