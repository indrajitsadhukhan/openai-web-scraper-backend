OUR ROLE



Developing a more personalised <br>
e-commerce experience





 

POWERED BY

Digital transformation














































The situation






The client wanted to  provide a seamless digital experience for its customer base which is not too conversant with digital technologies.
 
The client, a leading construction equipment player in India, wanted to provide a seamless digital experience for its customer base which is not too conversant with digital technologies. The client was operating with too many manual processes which were increasing expenses for everyone involved.
Data sanity and synchronisation were the main challenges faced by the  client due to the lack of real-time integration between systems. Manual  execution of processes for all stakeholders resulted in a very high turnaround time. The lack of centralised client data management resulted in poor engagement and interaction with clients. Customers were interacting with dealers and the construction company offline and a single unified  portal was missing.
Our client wanted to drive a more personalised and seamless e-commerce  experience, intended to serve as a one-stop-shop for clients, customers, dealers as well as business stakeholders.










PwC’s role
In this digital transformation project, PwC took on the role of the system  implementor. Our community of solvers provided subject matter expertise  in business, experience, and technology consulting.
The team helped design and implement the user experience, a digital-first solution which streamlined processes for various internal and external stakeholders. PwC also established expertise and experience in all  programme management related dimensions and delivered the desired  business outcome. After going live with each phase, PwC provided ongoing support to assure project maintenance, scalability, and success. 
The team analysed key personas, and envisioned experiences in line with  their decision-making habits and purchase behaviours. From product  comparisons to quote requests to machine servicing records and reminders,  the platform had the customer at the centre from its inception.
 





















Results
With a single platform, the client automated the manual processes,  reduced turnaround time, and improved the way it engages with  customers and dealers.















2x faster process for creation of service tickets
