2022 PwC India Digital Trust Insights Survey


















As companies pivot more toward digital business models, exponentially more data is generated and shared among organisations, partners and customers. This digital information has become the lifeblood of the interconnected business ecosystem and is increasingly valuable to organisations—and to skilled threat actors. Increasing digitisation also means companies are exposed to new digital vulnerabilities, making an effective approach to cybersecurity and privacy more important than ever.
At PwC, we help our clients transform from value protectors to value creators by building trust, promoting resilience and enabling the business. We are here to help you transform your organisation and drive growth, while staying resilient and preparing for the unexpected.
