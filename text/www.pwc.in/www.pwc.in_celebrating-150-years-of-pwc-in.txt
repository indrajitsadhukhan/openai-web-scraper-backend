In our 150 years of existence in India, we have endeavoured to always remain relevant, serve the nation and its people, and help chart a path that lifts up our national and regional economies. Now we must redouble those efforts in a concerted push to restore trust everywhere. It is a fitting role for an organisation whose declared purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems.

I stayed on at the firm because of the challenging job assignments, and the great importance given to ethics. At the staff recreational club, we would play games (like) carrom, cards, table tennis and cricket, every weekend.
Sattya Brata Ghosh











We always found that we did not really have to advertise our work. We had clients coming to us and asking us to come and work for them. The challenges and the quality of work that I faced at the firm were quite unique.
D G Rajan











I stayed at the firm for so long because I could always speak my mind. I have never been scared of any recrimination or reactions. The work that I got was very challenging and ensured that I was interested in coming to work every morning. Secondly, the friends I made are precious and despite the fact that I have retired for over three years, I am still in touch with all of them. 
Sharmila Karve











I stayed so long at the firm because of a very nice set of people, a very congenial atmosphere, and above all, a tremendous amount of job satisfaction. I was particularly enthused with the idea of going to different industries, the variety of work and the traveling.
Deepak Kapoor












I stayed at the firm for so long because of the opportunity I got, and the appreciation of independence of thought and action. An aspect of the firm’s ethos that I am most proud of is clients first, with maintaining your integrity. 
Sujit Bhattacharya


















The three words I’d use to describe this firm are energetic, eclectic and enriching. The firm has a large heart as well as conscience and all partners and staff have always been taken care of by the firm.
Kersi Vachha












An aspect of the firm’s ethos that I am extremely proud of is its integrity in everything, whether it is dealing with clients or behaviour with its people. Integrity is the hallmark of this organisation.
SK Mitra












I was fortunate to get the opportunity to set up and develop a new line of business like Management Consultancy. More importantly, the firm rewarded and provided recognition for good work.
SK Mitra












Independence of thought and action was appreciated. I got the opportunity for professional development because you’re always interacting with highly talented people, and the firm was always keen to recognise your capabilities and give you opportunities to service multidisciplinary clients.
Sujit Bhattacharya












The three words I’d use to describe the firm are:

Resilience: The firm anticipates or identifies changes, acts on changes and takes advantage of changes in terms of business opportunities.
Agility: We never sit down. We act quickly to address and solve clients’ problems and challenges.
Visionary: We plan ahead with imagination, way before our competitors are aware that changes are coming.

Partha Mitra












I am extremely proud of the integrity and ethics that the firm has always shown. In good times and in bad, I have always seen the firm sticking to the right side and that’s very important for a professional services firm.

Our Journey













  

1872
In the city of Calcutta in 1872, on the banks of the river Hooghly, a Scottish gentleman, William Adolphus Browne, set up his practice as public accountants and auditors.





  

1880
A little later in 1880, Marc Meugens, an Englishman, started a similar practice and together, they helped establish a sense of professionalism in the way the industry would operate in India. By investing in new relationships, these two practices eventually evolved, prospered and grew into two large professional firms in India – Lovelock & Lewes and Price Waterhouse. 





  

1950s
In the first years after India's independence, the partners remained British but in the early 1950s, that began to change. Soon after, both firms, Lovelock & Lewes and Price Waterhouse, inducted their first Indian partners. Rabindra Nath Sen was the first Indian to become a partner of Price Waterhouse in 1952, while Priyamohan Chakrabarti and Premanjan Niyogi became the first Indian partners of Lovelock & Lewes in 1953. 





  

1998
The winds of change were sweeping across the firms and then a major development emerged. Internationally, a major announcement was made of the worldwide merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand in 1998 to form PricewaterhouseCoopers, or as we know it today – PwC.
With the merger of these two global firms, Price Waterhouse and Lovelock & Lewes in India became members of the worldwide network of PwC firms, each being a separate legal entity.





  

2002
New regulations in the US and the UK required accounting firms to change the way they managed their consultancy business. It led to PwC firms in India along with the other international network of PwC firms divesting their consulting business to IBM in 2002 while continuing to accelerate at a steady pace and take on new growth opportunities.





  

2007-08
This was a landmark year for relevant PwC firms in India, given the conclusion of three key acquisitions:

ECS (which was earlier known as Eicher Consultancy Services)
Tax advisory practice of Ambit RSM (subsequently renaming Ambit)
Mumbai-based chartered accountancy firm Dalal & Shah added to the PW network of audit firms in India






  

2010: Rebranding
As a brand, the firm has always stood for warmth, trust and quality. To further emphasise this, in 2010, a global brand refresh was undertaken which went a long way in differentiating the ‘PwC experience’ – for the clients, people and communities.





  

2014: Booz Acquisition
As the firm grew in strength and capabilities, it realised that to truly lead in the modern marketplace, it has to strike the right balance of organic and inorganic growth opportunities. PwC acquired the strategy and operations consulting practice of Booz & Company, which was rechristened as Strategy&.





  

2021: Launch of our strategy - The New Equation
Today, the strides and measures taken are aligned to the new global strategy, The New Equation, that’s designed to solve challenges, build trust and deliver sustained outcomes for today and tomorrow.





  

2022 - Acquisition of Salesforce Consulting firm Venerate Solutions

In 2022, PwC completed its acquisition of Venerate Solutions, a Salesforce Consulting firm, enhancing its Salesforce consulting practice and platform engineering capabilities. It further established the firm’s position as a preeminent digital business partner with end-to-end transformation capabilities.
