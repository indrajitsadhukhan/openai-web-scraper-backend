2022 PwC India Digital Trust Insights Survey
The C-suite guide to simplifying for cyber readiness, today and tomorrow

Survey Focus
Global Digital Trust Insights 2022 is a survey of 3,602 business, technology, and security executives (CEOs, corporate directors, CFOs, CISOs, CIOs, and C-Suite officers) conducted in July and August 2021 across 60+ territories. This year’s survey offers the C-suite a guide to simplifying cyber with intention. It focuses on four questions that tend to get short shrift but, if properly considered, can yield significant dividends.
These questions may surprise and even challenge you because, in a survey about data trust, they aren’t technology-centered. Tech, in itself, is not the answer to simplified security.
Our focus, instead, is on working together as a unified whole, from the tech stack to the board room — starting at the top with the CEO. Security is a concern for the entire business, in every function and for every employee.

How can CEOs make a difference to your organisation?

Is your organisation too complex to secure?

How do you know if you’re securing your organisation against the most important risks to your business?

How well do you know your third-party and supply chain risks?

Changing investment priorities: Rethinking your cyber strategy to maximise benefits
With an ever-increasing focus on digitisation and the utilisation of enormous amounts of data, organisations have become heavily reliant on complex, deeply rooted and interdependent technologies.
This has created a playground for attackers as the number of reported attacks has surged over the years. Armed with highly sophisticated methods, attackers today are seeking and exploiting vulnerabilities and compromising systems and networks. Organisations are aware that the risk landscape is continuously evolving and investing more than ever in cyber security to manage their risks.
As the business environment turns more complex due to the interconnectedness of systems and information, the impact of a risk event is not limited, but rather has a domino effect with high consequences. Organisations are therefore gearing up to implement robust cyber security practices and controls to manage these risks.
In order to achieve their full cyber potential, organisations need to build capabilities in the following areas:

Security-first leadership: Organisations need to have a dedicated leadership group that understands the significance of cyber security and treats security as a priority.
Reducing complexity in cyber security: Organisations are operating in a complex cyber security ecosystem and often find it difficult to manage their risks due to underlying complexities. Simplifying cyber security and prioritising their investments in the right areas is the need of the hour. 
Securing against the critical risks of today and tomorrow: Organisations need to manage cyber risks effectively, including the blind spots emerging from their extended ecosystems, so that they can realise the value of their investments and operate risk free.
