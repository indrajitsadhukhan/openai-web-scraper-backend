Overview
Railways- poised for investment & growth
Railway system in India is ranked fourth-largest in the world, after US, Russia and China with network spread across 67,415 route km ( with 1,23,542 running track km) and about 7,300 stations. Railways in the year ending March 2019 carried 8.4 billion passengers and transported 1.2 billion tonnes of freight running 13,523 passenger trains and 9,146 freight trains daily on its network catering to the needs of sub-urban, long distance passenger and freight services.
During last five years there has been significant focus and investments in infrastructure upgradation including capacity augmentation, new lines, electrification and safety with capital expenditure of Rs 6,45,600 Cr with 13,687 rkm electrified and 1,458 Km/year of rail line doubling. In the next five years focus of Railways is to increase efficiency in operations through modernisation, increase modal share of Railways in freight , 100% electrification, capacity augmentation of track network, increase in average speed of passenger and freight trains, involvement of private sector in redevelopment of stations and private train operations along with asset monetisation of its operational infrastructure.
As per National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) investments of over Rs 13.67 lakh crore is envisaged upto 2025 which constitutes to 12% of overall investments planned under NIP. Projects worth Rs 1.61 lakh crore is aimed to be implemented through PPP mode. Further, Draft National Rail Plan envisages capital expenditure of Rs 38.22 Lakh crore till 2050 in the railway sector.
The contribution of Indian Railways was reflected more in the pandemic as the movement of essential commodities including foods, medicines, fertilizers, essential consumables was ensured as truck movements became restricted or delayed. With the focus of freight operations and infrastructure maintenance and upgradation works during COVID period, Railways in last few months in 2020 increased its freight loading over same period in previous year in November by 9%, October by 15% and September by 15% respectively. Railways evolved itself to convert the challenge into opportunity and completed many of the maintenance projects involving safety and capacity augmentation which were pending long.











Client issues









Loss of modal share in Freight business. While freight is where Railways makes money to offset losses in passenger services, it is losing out modal share in freight due to higher tariff, lack of services in terms of reliability, punctuality and additional costs for last mile connectivity. In 2017-18 modal share of Railways was 26% which is aimed to increase to 45% by 2030.
Capacity Constraint. Railways have more than 60% of routes being more than 100% utilized. This has led to loss in punctuality, lower throughput, lack of proper maintenance, route diversions and underutilisation of assets.
Lower Operating Ratio. Lower efficiency has led to lack of internal resources for investment. In FY-19, only 3% of investments was envisaged from Internal resources while 57% from Gross Budgetary Support and 40% from Extra Budgetary Resources.










Limited success in Private sector investments. Despite various schemes and policies for encouraging private sector participation, private sector investments have been low and limited to wagons operations, loco manufacturing, freight terminals. Recent initiatives are being undertaken for PPP in station redevelopment and Private Train operations, while PPP policy in Good-sheds have also been announced.
Cost and Time Overruns. Railway project face significant delays in execution. Out of 1705 projects ( projects costing more than Rs 150 Cr) on the monitor of Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, 310 projects belong to the Railways and more than 50% of these are delayed. Some of the reasons for delay have lack of funds, land acquisition, Forest land clearance, geographical surprises, delay in shifting of utilities and adverse law and order situation.
Limited Integrated planning and implementation in view of lack of co-ordination while planning and execution between multi-departmental units in Railways and inter-ministerial consultations.
