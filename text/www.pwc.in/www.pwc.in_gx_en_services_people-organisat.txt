A strategy for the evolution of leadership
There’s a gap between leadership skills today and what’s needed for tomorrow.
Leaders today need to be prepared to meet the ongoing challenges and demands of the future – and to deal with transformation at a rate never witnessed before. They face a series of interconnected challenges that are far-reaching, complex, and essential to get right. The global pandemic. Rapid digitisation. Supply chain disruptions. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). Upskilling and engaging employees. Geopolitical tensions. No matter the challenge, the path to finding a solution depends on the right leadership.
At PwC, we help leadership teams develop the understanding, skills, and capabilities they need to successfully lead through transformation. Looking at problems from new angles. Applying innovative mindsets and the latest technologies. Working as a community of solvers to uncover unexpected solutions that deliver sustained outcomes and build trust.

Top team effectiveness






Are your senior leadership groups achieving their maximum effectiveness and team performance? Our four-step approach is designed to improve leadership team fundamentals, enhance capabilities for performance, apply the right teaming models, and connect people more deeply through an emotional commitment.








Leadership assessments and succession planning






Do you have the leadership capabilities you need to execute your business strategy? Our analysis of leaders’ skills and capabilities can help you determine future leadership potential and development, and build the right pipeline of talent for your organisation.









Leadership training and development






We work with organisations to define their core leadership model, supported by innovative tools and processes. After assessing your leadership team’s specific needs, we can work with you to design, develop, and deliver the tailored learning experiences you need.








Leading through transformation 






Embracing and inspiring change requires an evolution in personal leadership style and how to work with colleagues. Individuals need to  understand why they are being asked to transform and change; they need their leaders to provide meaning and purpose. We can help you successfully create the leadership your organisation needs to successfully transform.









Leaders Solving for Tomorrow






Today’s leaders need one eye on the future. The ‘Leaders solving for tomorrow’ executive programme brings leaders from diverse organisations together with PwC’s Leadership Strategists and a diverse range of thinkers to make sense of the profound changes that are shaping the world today. Executives emerge with a renewed sense of their mission – and of themselves as leaders.
















Six paradoxes of leadership
Leaders and teams around the world are facing six important paradoxes. Learning to navigate these paradoxes is critical.









Globally minded: to be agnostic about belief system and market structure and be a student of the world.
Localist: to be fully committed to the success of a  local market.
The paradox is the need to be both deeply embedded in the local market and connected across the globe at the same time. This requires someone to be able to recognise their biases resulting from the lens through which they view the world and to learn how to operate most effectively in any locale, without compromising the success of another market in which they wish to operate. To be able to harness the power of the organisation in its largest sense to make significant and purposeful progress in unfamiliar places. This requires both global and local connectivity, and the ability to negotiate between locales to drive collective success.








Globally-minded localist

How do you navigate a world that is increasingly both global and local?





High Integrity: to maintain integrity and build trust in all interactions.
Politician: to accrue support, negotiate, form coalitions overcome resistance to maintain progress.
The paradox is that in a deeply political environment, people can lose their integrity. Much time is spent meeting the needs of other people and managing the politics of getting plans to happen. Driving change is a constant state of being for leaders, but change affects the balance of power and creates a scenario in which some parties feel like they are losing. In order to keep all people engaged on the optimal outcome for the organisation during times of change the integrity of the leader is even more critical. Work to reconcile the political requirements while maintaining integrity, because without integrity it is challenging to lead.








High-integrity politician

How do you navigate the politics of getting things to happen and retain your character?





Humble: to foster deep personal resilience in self and others, recognising when they need to help and be helped.
Hero: to exude confidence, with competitive flair and gravitas. 
The paradox is that leaders feel like they need to behave like heros - exuding confidence in these anxiety-inducing times. But having confidence is not the same as unwillingness to change course. Leadership requires the ability to take advice from many quarters and make decisions based on a variety of inputs. Leaders need personal resilience to admit when they are wrong, allow others to make mistakes, and foster confidence throughout the organisation. To be able to make smart decisions and navigate through failure are critical opposing characteristics leaders need to possess and will enable people to experience their leaders as humans.







Humble hero

How do you have the confidence to act in an uncertain world and the humility to recognise when you are wrong?





Strategic: to find insights and observations by looking to the future to inform decision making today.
Executor: to deliver exquisitely on today’s challenges.
The paradox is that usually people have an inclination towards strategy or execution. The most powerful approach is to articulate a strategy, understand how it needs to evolve, and execute with both the immediate need and changing future in mind. Executing without strategy creates a higher probability of an even more significant crisis in the future. However, it is also ineffective to spend a disproportionate amount of time thinking about the future and missing the need to execute now. Leaders should find a way to be strategic, bring the future into the present in order to solve today’s problems with tomorrow in mind, and get it done.







Strategic executor

How do you execute effectively while also being highly strategic?





Tech-savvy: to drive technology enhancement which generates future success.
Humanist: to understand deeply human effectiveness in any given system.
The paradox is that traditionally those with technical skills were not also acquiring the skills required to understand people’s needs or how to lead them. As a result, many people who are driving technological advancement aren’t equipped to consider the human implications of their work. This is also true in reverse as those who have responsibility for people haven’t always understood the impact technology will have on their business and workforce. The leader’s role is to nurture the success of the business and, in doing so, offer a better future for their people. That means balancing being technically savvy with a focus on humanity.







Tech-savvy humanist

How do you become increasingly tech savvy and remember that organisations are run by people, for people?





Traditioned: to connect deeply with the purpose of the original idea and bring this value to the present day.
Innovator: to drive innovation and try new things out; have the courage to fail and allow others to do so.

The paradox is that it is tempting to continue to execute the things you do really well, and miss the opportunities that will help you remain relevant. It requires the ability to respect the past and decide what needs to be brought forward into the future, while also having the courage to try new things. Too often innovation is considered a wholly greenfield experiment, rather than something that is incremental and builds on what already exists. It needs to be both and leaders should define when to preserve the past in moving to the future and when to create completely fresh.







Traditioned innovator

How do you use the past to help direct your future success?
