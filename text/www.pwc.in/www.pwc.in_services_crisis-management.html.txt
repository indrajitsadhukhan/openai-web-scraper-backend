PwC Crisis Management
With Crisis Management, we take a holistic view of the crises, enable insights and help our clients adapt to the new normal.

What we do
By your side, at every step.
Often, a crisis isn’t an isolated, contained incident. It isn’t fleeting. It builds, unfolds, peaks - and the effects can be long-lasting. And each crisis is different: some you know about in advance, some you know could happen one day, while others are just impossible to predict.
Our crisis specialists are backed up by the power of the global PwC network. We can convene strategists and data analysts. Professionals in cyber security or financial crime. Communications teams and project managers.

So while you won’t always know what will happen, or how things will play out, you will know you’ve got the right team by your side.









Prepare






Prepare
Build resilience, before a crisis hits.
We help organisations to anticipate and minimise the chances of a crisis occurring.

We work with you to review and assess your current capabilities to manage a crisis. We’ll draw on the knowledge and experience of our crisis professionals from around the PwC network – and use our proprietary crisis simulation technology – to help you improve and enhance your crisis response strategy and capabilities.

The result: you’ll be equipped with the governance, processes, tools and technology you need to respond with confidence to any crisis you might face.









Respond






Respond
Build confidence and take control.
When a crisis hits, business as usual becomes a thing of the past.

Responses to crises often lack long-term vision, discipline and structure. As a result, decision-making is paralysed by fear of making the wrong call. In fact, even though many organisations end up doing the right things, they can still be disjointed, lacking full integration across the spectrum of response efforts they put in place. When this happens, the big picture can be lost, costing you time, financial capital, and public trust.

The Crisis Management Team convenes crisis experts from across the PwC network to help you. Together, we provide you with a variety of solutions and insights – so you can understand, prioritise and address the crisis, build confidence with your stakeholders and take control of the situation.









Recover






Recover 
Emerge stronger, sooner, more resilient.
The effects of a crisis can be long-lasting. We’ll support you as you recover, helping you to stabilise your operations and adapt to a new ‘business as usual’. So your recovery becomes an opportunity for growth.

We help you create and implement new business strategies, and provide technical and functional expertise as well as short and long-term project management support. Beyond that, our ‘recover’ solutions will help you identify and capitalise on the lessons learned, so you’ll have stronger capabilities for crisis management in the future.
