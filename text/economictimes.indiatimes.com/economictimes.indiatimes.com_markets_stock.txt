However, a host of brokerage firms have initiated coverage on several stocks. They see a strong potential in these companies, with a targeted upside of up to 56%. These stocks belong to various industries such as information technology, consumer electronics and garments & apparel. Here is a list of six stocks on which brokerages initiated coverage:iStock2/7Dixon TechnologiesHSBC Global Research initiated coverage on Dixon Technologies with a Hold rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 3,100 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 11% from the current market prices."We expect Dixon to report -5% to +5% growth from 4Q FY23e to 2Q FY24e. Our FY24e revenue and EPS estimates are 7-8% below current consensus expectations. While we foresee significant opportunities from import substitution in the IT hardware and telecom segments, this is likely to be gradual and over the medium term (FY25e and beyond)," HSBC said.Agencies3/7Happiest Minds | CMP: Rs 784Yes Securities initiated coverage on Happiest Minds with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 1,080 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 38% from the current market prices."Strong revenue growth outlook along with superior margin profile makes it a credible play in the IT services space. Trades at PER of 31.7x on FY25E. Revenue /EBITDA /PAT are expected to grow at CAGR of 26.7%/27.1%/27.1% over FY22-FY25E," Yes Securities said.ETtech4/7Sula Vineyards | CMP: Rs 356IIFL Securities initiated coverage on Sula Vineyards with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 390 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 10% from the current market prices."Sula Vineyards provides an opportunity to invest in the nascent and fast-growing wine market in India. With 53% market share in the domestic 100% Grape Wine market, 25%+ Ebitda margin, secured long-term contracts for grapes, and highest distribution in the industry — Sula, is well placed to benefit from the secular growth story," IIFL Securities said.ETMarkets.com5/7Hitachi Energy | CMP: Rs 3,137HDFC Securities initiated coverage on Hitachi Energy with an Add rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 3,438 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 10% from the current market prices."Its revenue is expected to expand through grid automation and modernisation, rail electrification, expansion in the metro network, a rise of e-mobility, and hyper-growth in data centres. It has another Rs 50 billion revenue opportunity from Vande Bharat ancillary orders. Given robust order inflows, we expect HEI FY22-25E EPS CAGR of 67.9%," HDFC Securities said.Agencies6/7Raymond | CMP: Rs 1,176Systematix Institutional Equities initiated coverage on Raymonds with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 1,832 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 56% from the current market prices."An IPO of the engineering business and any fund-raising in the real estate business could help reduce the leverage and support future growth. Despite the strong up move from COVID-lows, valuations at 6x FY25E EV/EBITDA look quite attractive given the visible step-up in execution and growth trajectory," the brokerage said.Agencies7/7​TCS | CMP: Rs 3,120Brokerage firm Religare initiated coverage on Tata Consultancy Services with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 3,882 on TCS, which shows an upside potential of 24% from the current market prices."We have assigned a PE multiple of 24x (which is an average PE in the last 10 years) on FY25EPS and have initiated the coverage on TCS with a Buy rating. Growth can be impacted by an increase in attrition and high volatility in currencies as compared to the rupee," Religare said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
