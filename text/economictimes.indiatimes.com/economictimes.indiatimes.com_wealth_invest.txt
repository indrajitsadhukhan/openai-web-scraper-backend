Do note that the Supreme Court in its judgement dated November 4, 2022, had allowed 4 months to apply for a higher pension under EPS. Consequently, as per the SC order, the last date to apply for a higher pension under EPS was March 3, 2023. The window to apply for a higher pension till May 3, 2023, is only available to those employees who were members of EPF on September 1, 2014, and continued to be members of the EPF on or after September 1, 2014, but missed the opportunity to apply for higher pension before the expiry of earlier deadline. The employees who retired prior to September 1, 2014, and opted for higher pension under the pension scheme, made their contributions but their application, later on, was rejected by the EPFO must submit their application form on or before March 3, 2023. This is because no extension has been made for such employees. The circular for these employees was issued on December 29, 2022, and an online application form was issued in January 2023.Also Read: Why applying for higher EPS pension may be a golden opportunityPuneet Gupta, Tax Partner, People Advisory Services, EY India,"A welcome news from the EPFO - the deadline to file higher pension applications which was set by the Supreme Court in its Nov 2022 ruling as 3 March 2023 has been extended by the EPFO to 3 May 2023. This will give more time to employees to take an informed decision on whether or not to opt for higher pension - specifically given that the EPFO has issued guidelines only on 20 Feb 2023. Online link on the EPFO portal to file such higher pension applications have also been enabled. While filing such applications, one of the ask on the portal is to file copy of permission taken under Para 26(6) of the EPF Scheme through which approval is taken from the EPFO to make contributions to EPF on higher salary. Given that such permissions are practically not taken and it is standard practice to contribute to EPF basis full basic salary - such requirement to attach copy of permission under Para 26(6) of the EPF Scheme may be removed."Anshul Prakash, Partner, Employment Labour & Benefits, Khaitan & Co says, "Please note that the online portal to opt for higher pension benefits for employees who had retired from their services prior to 1 September 2014 (and had opted for higher pension benefits back then) was activated by EPFO in the month of January 2023. The said portal was activated pursuant to necessary directions and instructions for filing of applications by EPFO for the said category of employees. Owing to the time period already provided to the above category of employees to opt for higher pension benefits, there is no extension of time period for filing of applications for such employees and the last date to opt for higher pension benefits is 3 March 2023. The EPFO has extended the time period to 3 May 2023 only for employees who were members of the Employees’ Pension Scheme 1995 (‘EPS Scheme’) on 1 September 2014 and continued to be members of the EPS Scheme on or after 1 September 2014. No such extension has been specified for employees who had retired from their services prior to 1 September 2014 and had opted for higher pension benefits back then."Why there was a need to extend the last date to apply for a higher pension under EPSThough it appears that EPFO has extended the deadline (for certain EPS members) to submit an application for the higher pension under EPS from March 3, 2023, to May 3, 2023, no circular/notification by the retirement fund body has been issued for the same till the time of publishing. The last date to submit application for higher pension under EPS is May 3, 2023 is mentioned on the EPFO's Member's e-Sewa portal.  Earlier, the EPFO issued guidelines on the matter for eligible employees on February 20, 2023 - just 12 days before the expiry of the Supreme Court mandated deadline.Also Read: Eligible employees who missed higher EPS pension option earlier can still apply: Latest EPFO circularThere was a need for the extension of the deadline as employees wishing to apply needed time to collect various required documents to apply for the higher pension under the EPS. Further, there is no clarification regarding how much money they are required to pay or how much will be deducted from their Employees Provident Fund (EPF) corpus if they opt for a higher pension under EPS. EPFO itself, in its last circular (dated February 20, 2023) on the subject, had mentioned that further guidelines/clarifications would be issued but these are still awaited.PV Murthy, Head of labour practice, Economic Laws Practice - law firm says, "The EPFO has opened its portal last night and as mentioned by ELP earlier, the time to exercise the option has been extended till May 3rd, 2023.
