What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by the websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. The use of cookies is now standard for most websites.



















Our cookies, your choice
We use three categories of cookies on our sites:
Necessary Cookies
These cookies are necessary for the website to operate. Our website cannot function without these cookies and they can only be disabled by changing your browser preferences.
Analytical/Performance Cookies
These cookies allow us to measure and report on website activity by tracking page visits, visitor locations and how visitors move around the site. The information collected does not directly identify visitors. We drop these cookies to help us analyse the data.
Marketing & Social Media Cookies
Marketing cookies help us provide you with personalised and relevant services or advertising, and track the effectiveness of our digital marketing activities. Social media cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.


















Use of cookies on PwC websites
We utilise cookies, and other online identification technologies such as web beacons, or pixels to provide users with an improved user experience. 
Registered users
We use these technologies to make navigation of the websites easier for you and to better deliver tailored content to you. If you choose to become a registered user, we will use cookies to facilitate your registration and remember your preferences. If you are a registered user, you will receive the benefits of registration only if the necessary cookies are allowed to operate, which include those cookies used as part of registration.
Analytics and site statistics
We also use these technologies to gather usage information and statistics regarding use of the websites. For example, we collect information about page visits and navigation to determine what articles and topics are of greatest interest and if users are able to find content easily. Likewise, we collect information about which articles and videos are viewed and whether videos are viewed in their entirety to determine what content is of most interest to users. We also use usage information to generate various reports regarding use of the websites. These reports contain aggregated information about users and do not single out users individually. If you are a registered user we may also collect information on what specific interests you have, including what articles you have viewed on the site in order to understand what content interests you most.
Information about the cookies used on our websites can be found below. Individual PwC sites may use additional cookies or third-party analytics tools.  For more information about the cookies and third-party tools used on individual sites, please review the cookie information on the individual sites you visit.
Measuring effectiveness of our activities
We may utilise online identification technologies from marketing partners, third party sites and social media platforms. These technologies help us measure the efficacy of our marketing and awareness campaigns and to understand how visitors navigate to the Websites from a PwC ad. We use these technologies to compile statistics about visitors who interact with the Websites and other PwC online content, to gauge the effectiveness of our ads, and to provide more pertinent information to our visitors.


















Cookie disclosure
The following section explains the types, categories, and purpose of cookies on the Websites. By using our cookie preference management tool you can select the types of non-essential cookies placed on your device.  By continuing to use these websites you consent to the deployment of necessary cookies for the stated purpose.
Types of cookies:
Session cookies: these cookies remain in your browser during your browser session only, i.e. until you leave the website.
Persistent cookies: these cookies remain in your browser for a set period of time after the browser session (unless deleted by you).
PwC does not sell your data to any third parties.  Please see our privacy policy for more details.
