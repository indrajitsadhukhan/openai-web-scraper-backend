Hello everyone,
Welcome to the new page for campus careers.

I look forward to engaging and interacting with all of you – our new community of solvers – to deliver transformational solutions to our clients together!

I joined PwC India as a Senior Associate as a part of Technology Consulting for the Government Technology vertical. For the past six months I have been working to build a robust Startup and IT ecosystem in one of the most scenic, most visited state in our country, Goa! Last six months have been nothing short of a learning experience for me, as I got my first look at the manner in which the government functions and how the firm adds value to its client. From interacting with various high-level stakeholders, collaborating with multiple teams, formulating outreach programs to being on ground to understand end-user pain points, my experience helped me contextualize things that I had studied in my college courses. I have also been fortunate to regularly interact with the senior leadership of the firm and was able to gain insightful career advice through my conversations with them.

It has a steep learning curve for me given that I am not from a Renewable Energy background. But it has been very challenging and that's what made me more confident. My team members have been very supportive and I got to learn a lot in the past 6 months from each of them. Looking forward to learning more in the coming days.

The team at PwC has put in a lot of thought to help me get a good grasp of cybersecurity concepts and blend into the work culture. I always feel like I have someone who I can share my ideas freely without being dismissed as an intern. I love seeing the energy and passion in the team when it comes to doing the work or even other things in life. At the end of the day, it's the people at PwC India who have made this an excellent and rewarding experience for me.

PwC India really gave me a good platform, where I could learn as well as grow along with contributing towards the ongoing project. Even though this was my first internship, the team and the management never let me feel that way. They provided me with continuous support. I got exposure to the projects and market. I got to know about policies and general practices that firms generally follow. Platforms like Vantage and LinkedIn Learning have helped me upskill myself. In short, the internship in PwC India helped me refine my skills and abilities,which I believe will definitely help me further my career. I am really grateful to PwC India for giving me such a great opportunity and for giving me the best possible start to my career.

My journey at PwC has been interesting and informative. When I joined in January, I didn't know much about the firm and how it operates. I was just a person with theoretical knowledge. I signed up for various tasks and realized that this is the field that I was looking for. PwC is not an office or a company for me. It is my second home where I felt a connection like a family.

There are ups and downs in this starting journey where it take time to get allocated to a project, it test your patience but so many things to learn.There are fun activities, TC university, townhall,work for NGOs etc which will balance things.Overall journey was good till now and hope it will get better.
