Making the best of investing in the growing Oil & Gas and emerging alternatives sector

Oil & Gas companies are globally witnessing an increasingly uncertain business environment.

With the recent COVID-19 pandemic also contributing to the underwhelming market growth, there is increased pressure on the incumbents to optimise their asset portfolios and product mix to build competitive advantage and create unique value propositions.
Amidst this, in India, the gas sector is growing leaps and bounds. LNG imports are growing caused by added infrastructure. The national oil companies are adding newer refining and petrochemicals capacity. Distribution, retail, virtual pipelines are adding to the capital demand.

Digital technologies offer opportunities to reduce costs in various ways and is also creating new business models that are being pioneered by new entrants from outside the sector. To maintain competitiveness, businesses must ensure that their organisation is ready to meet new digital challenges to respond to customer needs, and where possible, define the future of digital engagement.
Digital technologies offer significant opportunity for improved quality and cost savings across the OGEA sector by enabling more efficient design, operation and maintenance of assets throughout their lifecycle. Digital projects have delivered millions of dollars in savings by optimising production and business processes.

Companies are digitising essential functions within their internal vertical value chain, as well as with their horizontal partners along the supply chain.

Joining the emerging alternatives market supporting circular economy and succeeding
Realising the pressing need for transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources, PwC has pioneered the efforts for mainstreaming of next generation fuels like hydrogen, biofuels, synfuels, etc. These fuels can mitigate the concerns regarding round the clock supply, storage and also caters to sectors or process that are hard to electrify.

Strategy and operations
The global crude oil price plunge that got triggered in 2014-15 has cast a long shadow for the oil and gas producers. Despite signs of gradual recovery during 2016-18, uncertainty still prevails. Sluggish economic growth in some of the largest oil importing nations such as China and US, growing shift to more cleaner energy sources coupled with efficiency gains in shale gas production have only widened the demand and supply gap. With the majority of Oil & Gas companies deferring their capital expenditures, the opportunities for contractors and service providers have contracted drastically. How to sustain and grow in such a competitive environment is the key question being grappled with by oil and gas contractors and service providers today.
How PwC can help
We can help you make the right moves to expand your opportunity horizon and develop a competitive advantage that positions you favourably for addressing the opportunities.
Strategy
We have extensive experience in designing and implementing strategies for EPC contractors as well as service providers in the sector.

With prolonged periods of low crude prices and long-term forecasts having been considerably downgraded, it is the contractors and service providers that have been squeezed for margin. Oil and gas field developers are struggling with viability of their projects which is getting reflected in deferment of their projects. From efficiency improvements to looking at restructuring to leaner organisations are some of the areas the contractors and service providers are resorting to, to address such challenges.

Virtual pipeline using LNG
The virtual natural gas/LNG pipeline replicates the continuous flow of a physical pipeline, particularly in areas where physical pipeline is not available. In India, due to delays in developing physical pipelines, virtual gas pipeline becomes critical in providing gas access to customers. Virtual pipeline system delivers LNG by road, rail and marine transport to areas/customers that are not connected by physical gas pipelines.

PwC has a dedicated team to support you on commercial, economic, regulatory, policy and technical aspects of setting up virtual gas pipeline.
