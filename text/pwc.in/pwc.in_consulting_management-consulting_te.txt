Overview
We help Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) companies around the globe navigate through complex business problems to deliver operational, strategic, technological and financial effectiveness across the industry value chain. We have also helped them reshape strategies in the new normal and reinvent themselves in the era of digital disruption given the current Covid crisis. With consumer behavior constantly evolving and the Covid-19 pandemic proving to be a catalyst, the TMT industry overall has witnessed an interesting intersection.
Telecom operators continue to meet the increased demand of the customers in line with the changing needs and fulfil the requirements of the critical infrastructure. Operators around the globe are focused on improving their network resiliency and the impact of the pandemic on their network costs, particularly the investments in 5G and the new emerging technologies. The corporate sector recognises the imperative to digitalise the workplace enabled by various solutions such as cloud, automation and big data, which shape the market opportunity for the telecom companies. Technology is growing at a rapid pace in India and worldwide. In response to the global pandemic, Indian organisations have fast-tracked the adoption of digital transformation programmes. There has also been a shift in some of the upcoming digital trends such as 3D printing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, drones, internet of things, machine learning, robotic process automation, virtual reality, etc. The transformative effect of 5G and the unprecedented pandemic have created a notable shift in trends and consumer behaviour for the media and entertainment industry. The hardest impacted segments include entertainment and recreation, cinemas, theaters, airlines, hospitality, among others, which monetise through physical and social interaction. However, as people continue to stay at home, enterprises are expected to accelerate their pace of digitisation and segments such as over-the-top internet advertising and video gaming are likely to benefit. The sector witnessed multiple partnerships amongst technology B2B players, telecom operators and media companies as organisations strive to meet new consumer dynamics and shifting preferences for digital applications in an increasingly virtual world.
