The future of the automotive industry in India is in the process of being disrupted. Pollution, congestion, evolving business models and regulatory compliance are the top factors driving disruption in the automotive industry in India. New value chains are getting created amidst high levels of volatility in the market demand. Automotive OEMs and component companies will need to transform to succeed in this changing environment. A transformation in the structure, process and culture is needed to be agile, flexible and technology-enabled.
In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in vehicular emissions due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Competition among automakers is also heating up as they attempt to differentiate themselves from each other with new features and technology. The advent of electric vehicles (EVs) in the automotive industry has also spurred changes in the buying behaviour of consumers while purchasing automobiles.

Committed to India: The future of mobility
Transcript














Indian automotive market is witnessing five megatrends that will transform the industry. 















Rapidly evolving customer needs: 
  
With increasing spending capacity, high levels of product awareness, rapidly evolving expectations and demand for personalised products & services, customers are taking center stage of the entire automotive ecosystem. Understanding changing customer needs and having the ability to serve them differentially will be a key competitive advantage.With an increase in disposable income and the penetration of new technologies, it is expected that the Indian economy will have a higher demand for vehicles. They seek value-added services such as maintenance, insurance, and financing. Combating these changing consumer behaviour trends and catering to consumers' upgraded needs is best served by an absolute automotive strategy consulting service provided by our strong automotive consulting services.

Transforming for Growth









The Indian automotive sector is witnessing a shift towards new technologies. With the rise of electric vehicles, connected cars, and autonomous driving technologies, it has become imperative for businesses to keep up with the latest trends and innovations in the industry.

By providing insight into emerging technologies and trends, helping businesses develop strategies for adopting these new technologies, and providing the tools and resources to implement these strategies effectively, our automotive strategy consulting services help businesses stay ahead of the curve.











Disruptive impact of technology: at three levels
 
On vehicles (e.g. electric, driverless, connected): In the automobile industry, technology has revolutionised the design, production, and sale of automobiles. Autonomous transportation, including shared fleets and ride-hailing services like Uber will see a significant rise.
On supply chain and operations ( digitalisation, robotics, 3-D printing): The introduction of new technologies has substantially impacted automobile manufacturers' production processes, resulting in enhanced cost effectiveness, quality control, and product customisation. The automotive industry is a vital component of the economy and has a substantial impact on the local and global economies.
On business models (e.g. mobility as a service, vehicle sharing): As modern Indian consumers transition to a greener eco-system, the EV supply chain is expected to expand at an accelerated pace. Evolved digitisation and consumers' prompt adaptability are changing the future of mobility in India. Automotive consulting companies assist businesses in developing a sturdy business model in accordance with current trends and offering customised services to modern consumers. Automotive Industry participants must, therefore, reinvent themselves to find new ways of creating and delivering value in the future.



 













Dynamic regulatory environment:
  
Major regulatory interventions, such as the accelerated transition from BS IV to BS VI, the adoption of electric vehicles, safety rules and stringent vehicle standards, are leading to a shift in vehicle technology. This is creating significant challenges for the automotive industry and related sectors such as energy, oil & gas, transportation, and urban development. Additionally, the government is investing extensively in research and development (R&D) to create new technologies that minimise air pollution and enhance fuel efficiency. The automotive industry has already invested in the infrastructure required for conformity with BS VI, demonstrating an increased commitment to a green automotive industry. This comprises new cars, engines, transmissions, new technology such as turbocharging, direct injection, and new pollution control systems.

E-mobility - The upcoming disruption
















Changing face of mobility infrastructure:
 
Development of smart infrastructure (e.g. smart cities), alternative modes of transportation and the drive to enable electric vehicle charging infrastructure will change the face of mobility infrastructure. To decrease pollution, charging stations for electric vehicles are currently in use in many places, but there is still a long way to go before electric vehicles become the norm. With the proliferation of electric vehicles In India, infrastructure would require that automotive companies modify their tactics.




 









Global  interconnectedness:
 
India is emerging as a priority market for global automotive companies. A more macro-oriented perspective on industries has replaced traditional functions as a result of globalisation. To be successful in such an environment, businesses require a well-defined plan, the ability to manage risks effectively, and the capacity to expand their organisation's capabilities. Only the top automotive consulting firms in India will take a strategic approach to revamp organisational modes of operation while keeping globalisation accountability in mind.
