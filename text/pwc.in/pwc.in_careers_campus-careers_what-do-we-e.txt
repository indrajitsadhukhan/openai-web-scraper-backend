What do we expect from you
















We use the PwC Professional framework across the PwC network to clearly identify the attributes and behaviors our people need to help achieve our purpose –to build trust in society and solve important problems. It’s our global leadership development framework which exists to support an individual in development and career progression at each level.









There are five key attributes – Whole leadership, Business acumen, Technical and digital, Global and inclusive, and Relationships – and each is equally important.


















Have a look at the five dimensions of the PwC Professional framework:



















Business Acumen
Technical and Digital
Whole Leadership
Relationships
Global and Inclusive





Business Acumen










Business acumen is all about the business knowledge and insights that you bring into the organisation as an employee. Considering the dynamic business scenario, it is necessary to continuously deepen and broaden our understanding about the business. It is expected that we articulate a relevant point of view and make necessary judgments based on the information we have and demonstrate analytical thinking, which will result in developing a business and creating a sustainable value. 





















Technical and Digital










We apply a range of technical, digital and other professional capabilities to deliver quality and value. As we operate under a dynamic environment, it’s necessary for an individual to upskill themselves on technical as well as digital platforms so that we deliver quality and value to our clients. You will be expected to produce high-quality work which adheres to the relevant professional standards, follow risk management and compliance procedures, validate data and analysis for accuracy and relevance.





















Whole Leadership










We expect an individual to lead themselves and others. Leading yourself means having a mindset to develop and learn through every opportunity that you have, being open-minded and flexible. Leading others means promoting an inclusive environment, contributing to a culture of continuous development and inspiring others and creating a positive impact.





















Relationships










Maintaining cordial relationships means empathising with others, communicating with confidence and clarity, speaking with a purpose and growing sustainable relationships beyond our existing network. We expect an individual to invest in developing meaningful and sustainable relationships. Creating an exceptional client experience by being client and user focused goes a long way.





















Global and Inclusive










In a complex and continually evolving world, each day will be different, bringing various challenges that can influence an individual’s decision making at a global level. Hence, it is important and necessary to operate and collaborate effectively with a mindset that transcends boundaries and embraces diverse perspectives to develop a better solution.
