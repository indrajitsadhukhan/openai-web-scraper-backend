Read Today's Paper 		   HZL may not Act on Proposal to Buy Vedanta’s Zinc BizSECTIONSHZL may not Act on Proposal to Buy Vedanta’s Zinc BizBy Banikinkar Pattanayak, ET BureauLast Updated: Apr 05, 2023, 06:02 AM ISTRate StoryShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePDFCommentSynopsisFacing strong opposition from the government, Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) is unlikely to act on the proposal to buy parent Vedanta’s global zinc business in a $2.98 billion cash deal, said people aware of the matter.AgenciesFacing strong opposition from the government, Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) is unlikely to act on the proposal to buy parent Vedanta’s global zinc business in a $2.98 billion cash deal, said people aware of the matter.“HZL isn’t going to pursue this plan now,” one of them told ET.Another person said, “HZL hasn’t presented any non-cash deal option to the government yet. It is likely to hold its next board meeting on April 21, by which time the current proposal would have lapsed.”As per the rules, if the HZL board’s January 19 proposal isn’t endorsed by shareholders within three months, it will automatically lapse, the second person added.An HZL spokesperson said the date for the next board meeting hasn’t yet been “declared,” while declining to comment on the proposed cash deal.The government has warned of legal action if the company went ahead with the proposed deal. HZL was privatised over two decades ago but the government still holds a 29.54% stake in the miner. Vedanta holds 64.92% of HZL.In the case of a related-party transaction, minority shareholders need to approve the proposal by a majority. In this case, the proposal cannot pass without the government’s consent, given its nearly 30% stake in HZL.The cash deal would have allowed Vedanta Resources, the parent company of Vedanta, to reduce its debt burden. The deal spooked investors, pushing HZL’s share price down.The uncertainty also forced the government to defer a plan to sell a part of its stake in HZL in March via the offer for sale (OFS) route.The government also wrote to the capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), reinforcing its opposition to the HZL board’s plan.Since the HZL board resolution on January 19, the company’s share has dropped 21%, compared with a 3% fall in the BSE Sensex. On Monday, HZL closed at Rs 297.95 on the BSE, up 1.6%.On March 16, the company declared a Rs 26 per share dividend, the fourth for FY23, entailing a Rs 10,985.83 crore cash outgo, the bulk of which will go to Vedanta and the government.S&P Global Ratings in February said that Vedanta Resources’ credit ratings might come under pressure if it is unable to raise $2 billion and sell its overseas zinc assets.Vedanta had earlier said all payments due up to March 31 had been made and that it had slashed debt by $2 billion in the past year.On April 3, S&P said the mining and metals giant has debt servicing obligations of about $3 billion, including interest and inter-company loans, in FY24. “It will have at least another $1-billion obligations that require funding until March 2024,” it said.S&P expects the company to secure additional funds to support liquidity beyond December 2023. “The company is discussing with banks and investors on multiple funding options for at least another $2 billion,” S&P said.

However, a host of brokerage firms have initiated coverage on several stocks. They see a strong potential in these companies, with a targeted upside of up to 56%. These stocks belong to various industries such as information technology, consumer electronics and garments & apparel. Here is a list of six stocks on which brokerages initiated coverage:iStock2/7Dixon TechnologiesHSBC Global Research initiated coverage on Dixon Technologies with a Hold rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 3,100 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 11% from the current market prices.""We expect Dixon to report -5% to +5% growth from 4Q FY23e to 2Q FY24e. Our FY24e revenue and EPS estimates are 7-8% below current consensus expectations. While we foresee significant opportunities from import substitution in the IT hardware and telecom segments, this is likely to be gradual and over the medium term (FY25e and beyond),"" HSBC said.Agencies3/7Happiest Minds | CMP: Rs 784Yes Securities initiated coverage on Happiest Minds with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 1,080 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 38% from the current market prices.""Strong revenue growth outlook along with superior margin profile makes it a credible play in the IT services space. Trades at PER of 31.7x on FY25E. Revenue /EBITDA /PAT are expected to grow at CAGR of 26.7%/27.1%/27.1% over FY22-FY25E,"" Yes Securities said.ETtech4/7Sula Vineyards | CMP: Rs 356IIFL Securities initiated coverage on Sula Vineyards with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 390 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 10% from the current market prices.""Sula Vineyards provides an opportunity to invest in the nascent and fast-growing wine market in India. With 53% market share in the domestic 100% Grape Wine market, 25%+ Ebitda margin, secured long-term contracts for grapes, and highest distribution in the industry — Sula, is well placed to benefit from the secular growth story,"" IIFL Securities said.ETMarkets.com5/7Hitachi Energy | CMP: Rs 3,137HDFC Securities initiated coverage on Hitachi Energy with an Add rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 3,438 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 10% from the current market prices.""Its revenue is expected to expand through grid automation and modernisation, rail electrification, expansion in the metro network, a rise of e-mobility, and hyper-growth in data centres. It has another Rs 50 billion revenue opportunity from Vande Bharat ancillary orders. Given robust order inflows, we expect HEI FY22-25E EPS CAGR of 67.9%,"" HDFC Securities said.Agencies6/7Raymond | CMP: Rs 1,176Systematix Institutional Equities initiated coverage on Raymonds with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 1,832 on the stock, which shows an upside potential of 56% from the current market prices.""An IPO of the engineering business and any fund-raising in the real estate business could help reduce the leverage and support future growth. Despite the strong up move from COVID-lows, valuations at 6x FY25E EV/EBITDA look quite attractive given the visible step-up in execution and growth trajectory,"" the brokerage said.Agencies7/7​TCS | CMP: Rs 3,120Brokerage firm Religare initiated coverage on Tata Consultancy Services with a Buy rating. The brokerage firm set a target price of Rs 3,882 on TCS, which shows an upside potential of 24% from the current market prices.""We have assigned a PE multiple of 24x (which is an average PE in the last 10 years) on FY25EPS and have initiated the coverage on TCS with a Buy rating.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader is accused of irregularities in the framing and implementation of the now-withdrawn excise policy 2021-22 in which several officials, businesspersons and politicians too are under probe. Sisodia has been sent to the CBI remand till March 4.However, the AAP has denied all allegations of a scam in the excise policy. Calling the investigation politically motivated, it has launched huge protests against the BJP. How it all startedIn July last year, Lieutenant governor VK Saxena had recommended a CBI investigation into Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 after a report by Delhi chief secretary established prima facie violations of various acts and rules in addition to “deliberate and gross procedural lapses” to provide “undue benefits” to liquor licensees. The excise department is headed by Sisodia.The LG reportedly found substantive indications of “financial quid pro quo” at the top political level. Sisodia was accused of undue financial favours to the liquor licensees much after the tenders had been awarded and thus caused huge losses to the exchequer MORE STORIES FOR YOU✕Liquor policy scam case: Delhi court sends AAP's Manish Sisodia to CBI custody till March 4Manish Sisodia arrested to divert public attention from Adani issue: AAPKerala CM terms arrest of Sisodia as an attack on democracy« Back to recommendation storiesI don't want to see these stories becauseThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthersSUBMITCiting sources in the government, a TOI report said the Excise Department allowed a waiver of Rs 144.36 crore singularly to the liquor cartel on the tendered license fee under the excuse of Covid-19 pandemic. The department also refunded earnest money of Rs 30 crore to the lowest bidder of the licence of Airport Zone, when it failed to obtain NOC from the airport authorities. Another allegation was that the excise department in its 8 November 2021 order revised the formula of the calculation of rates of foreign liquor and removed the levy of import pass fee of Rs 50 per case on beer without approval of the L-G and the Cabinet, thus making it cheaper for retailers causing loss of revenue to the state exchequer. The chief secretary, according to the TOI report, also found lapses in the process of awarding licence for two liquor vends in each ward. Some of the decisions, it was alleged, were taken by Sisodia without due approval and these were attempted to be legalized by getting the stamp of a post-facto Cabinet decision. The report by the chief secretary to the LG was said to be in accordance with Rule 57 of the Transaction of Business Rules 1993, which mandates the former to flag any deviation from laid down procedures to latter and the chief minister.The probe agencies have levelled several kinds of allegations, from violating government rules and procedures to money laundering. They have arrested several persons, including a few allegedly close to Sisodia who were accused of channeling the kickbacks. Businessman Dinesh Arora, alleged to be Sisodia's aide, has turned approver in the case. The link to Goa electionsEarly this month, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) accused the AAP government in Delhi of using a part of the kickbacks from the liquor scam to fund AAP's campaign for Goa assembly election. The ED alleged that AAP's media head Vijay Nair in connivance had received kickbacks on behalf of leaders of AAP amounting to Rs 100 crore from the so-called ""South Group"". These funds were used in the election campaign of the AAP for Goa assembly. Cash payments to the tune of Rs 70 lakh were made to the volunteers who were part of the survey teams, the ED alleged.The ED alleged the kickbacks were paid in advance to the AAP leaders through Nair by the South Group as part of an understanding. “Against the kickbacks paid, the South Group secured uninhibited access, undue favours, attained stakes in established wholesale businesses and multiple retail zones (over and above what was allowed in the policy),” the ED alleged. To recover the kickbacks paid in advance, the partners of the South Group were given 65% stake in IndoSpirits, the company which controlled the liquor distribution in Delhi, in collusion with the accused Sameer Mahendru, the managing director of the company, the ED alleged.What is the South Group?According to the ED, prominent members of the South Group are Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, a YSR Congress MP from Ongole constituency in Andhra Pradesh; his son Magunta Raghava Reddy; Sarath Reddy, a non-executive director,of Aurobindo Pharma; and K. Kavitha, the daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Two weeks ago, the ED arrested Magunta Raghava Reddy after prolonged questioning. Raghava’s name had cropped up in the initial inquiry into the scam several months before his arrest. However, his father had denied his involvement. The Magunta family has been in the liquor business for several decades now. They have been the South India distributors for the UB Group, which is based in Karnataka. Early this month, the CBI arrested a Hyderabad-based chartered accountant, Butchibabu Gorantla, for his alleged role in the formulation and implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy. Butchi Babu was formerly the chartered accountant of K. Kavitha. The CBI has accused Butchi Babu of causing wrongful gain to Hyderabad-based wholesale and retail licensees and their beneficial owners. The Auribindo Pharma and Pernod Ricard angleIn November last year, the ED arrested P. Sarath Chandra Reddy of the Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma group and Binoy Babu of wine and spirits company Pernod Ricard under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Reddy is accused of being instrumental in alleged cartelisation of suppliers and playing a key role in routing of alleged kickbacks. Babu is also said to be a party to the alleged cartelisation process.According to the ED, Trident Chemphar Ltd, a group company of Aurobindo Pharma, controlled two zones in Delhi for liquor distribution, besides two zones by Avantika Contractors Pvt Ltd and one zone by Organomix Ecosystems, all controlled by Sarath. “Sarath Reddy Penaka is a key partner of the South Group. The other partners are Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, Raghav Magunta, Sarath Reddy and K Kavitha. The group gave Rs 100 crore kickbacks in advance to the AAP leaders through Vijay Nair,” the ED has alleged in its chargesheet filed in a special PMLA court.""He was effectively controlling five retail zones through his group company Trident Chemphar Pvt Ltd and proxy entities namely, Organomix Ecosystems and Sri Avantika Contractors in violation of the excise policy, which barred any person from controlling more than two retail zones,"" the ED claimed.The ED alleged that Sarath Reddy was a key partner in the South Group, which had Sameer Mahendru, who owns liquor manufacturing units along with Pernod Ricard (PRI), as a partner. “PRI had made Indo Spirits its wholesale distributor, wherein Indo Spirits was owned by Sameer Mahendru, Arun Ramachandra Pillai and Prem Rahul Manduri. Sarath Reddy along with others had financial interests in this entity through proxies. It has also been revealed that Sarath Reddy was putting the investment in Indo Spirits,” the ED claimed. South Group controlled mine retail zones through a web of proxies and benami entities, according to the ED.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

ET Spotlight SpecialThe ‘MAMA India - The Digital Bharat 2.0’ event – the Indian edition of AppsFlyer’s iconic global MAMA event series, which was held in Mumbai on December 2, 2022 – had several important takeaways for stakeholders of the Indian app ecosystem, including insights on the rise of app users from Tier 2 and 3 market, their unique consumer behavior, and related product needs. By providing a definitive platform for top leaders in business and policy to come together with Indian app ecosystem stakeholders, the MAMA India event by AppsFlyer, in partnership with the Economic Times, catalyzed conversations and connections to enable startup founders and investors, product leaders, mobile marketing heads, and app developers to navigate India’s rapidly evolving mobile app economy and stay abreast of the most effective mobile marketing and product-market-fit strategies to cater to a fast-evolving consumer base.“I think the last ten years have been a very spectacular time for India… it's the case where you saw the confluence of several sorts of enablers coming together in a way that none of us could have predicted. And this has happened not just for the India-building-for-India consumer-tech businesses, but it's also for India-building-products-for-the-world,” said Shweta Bhatia, Partner, Head of Technology Investments, Eight Roads Ventures, India, in an investor roundtable discussion moderated by Kamlesh Bhatia, Head of Digital Innovations at AWS, India.In the same roundtable with other marquee investors from the Indian startup ecosystem like Alok Misra of General Atlantic, and Amol Warange, Director- Investments, Omidyar, the panelists decoded their playbook for identifying winning startup ideas, shared their outlook for the Indian startup ecosystem and thoughts on their top sector picks while elaborating on the key strategies that startups must adopt to ensure sustainable growth in a market that is wrought by uncertainty and volatility. Like the investor roundtable, the MAMA India event also featured a series of focused roundtables on the themes of diversity, product development, and app marketing, where women leaders and entrepreneurs, Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs), Chief Product Officers (CPOs), and app ecosystem enablers spotlighted the key growth opportunities and innovation avenues for Indian app developers. App marketing lessonsAt the CMO roundtable on the topic ‘Unlocking Innovation and Driving Growth Across The Marketing Ecosystem,’ marketing heads like Gaurav Verma, Associate Vice President, User Growth, Games24x7, Rajan Bansal, VP - Growth Marketing Head, Airtel, Ranjana Mangla, Sr. Vice President & Head of Ad Revenue - SonyLiv, and Vakul Agarwal, Vice President - Growth, Licious delved on a range of strategies that marketers can adopt to drive user acquisitions, ensure data analytics and retention, one of the major challenges faced by marketers today. “I think if you look at it for any marketer, I think it's a boon. At the same time, it's a very complex situation to be in today's world, because honestly, data is very complex to study. There is no single source of data in digital, unfortunately, to really tell you where your customer is going from point A to point B… it is a very complex job. But I think it's very important for marketers to see it as an opportunity. And I think that's exactly what everyone's trying to do in that complex world to really try and find that perfect mix,” said Ranjana Mangla, Sr. Vice President & Head of Ad Revenue - SonyLiv. From the opportunity that brands today have to talk to customers through many channels, unlike in the past, to tips on how to build an effective martech stack, define the best mobile marketing strategies and the right measurement tools for your business, the speakers at the marketing panel highlighted a range of best practices and themes emerging in the marketing ecosystem. “Traditionally, marketing, we all have looked at from a brand perspective, doing acquisitions, creating a lot of top of the funnel for the org. I think in the last few years, we have seen marketing going beyond it. And I think it will further evolve,” said Rajan Bansal, VP - Growth Marketing Head, Airtel, highlighting the recent creation of functions such as Employer Branding that go beyond the traditional definitions of marketing and the need for deriving greater value from the existing user base. “If I look at customers, apart from acquisition today, even from the existing user base, upsell and cross-sell have become very big revenue lines for most of the industries. So marketing has to figure out how do you personalize it. And how do you extract value from the existing user base also… eventually, marketing is somewhere embedded in every part of the organization. It's not a cost or revenue; it eventually unlocks the value of whatever the organization is doing. It just gives a multiplier factor to it,” added Bansal. Tech and product lessons“Your marketing tech stack evolves as your product evolves. And as your marketing goals changes… martech space is changing so much that there's no point in thinking of a really long-term strategy. When you talk about adopting a tool or building anything, it's more practical to think about the medium term, because things are evolving just too fast,” said Gaurav Verma, Associate Vice President, User Growth, Games24x7. At the product visionaries panel on the topic ‘Turning a product into a brand and finding the perfect product-market fit,’ Apoorva Sharma, Associate Director Product, upGrad, Saichithra Swaminathan, Chief Product Officer, Matrimony.com, Dilip Chandra, VP - Product & Analytics, aha, and Himavant Kurnala, Chief Product Officer - Marketplace, Reliance Retail also deep dived into how companies can create the right product experience for their customers while also building effective consumer relationships. MAMA India - The Digital Bharat 2.0: Pristyn Care's Garima Sawhney on role of healthtech in IndiaGarima Sawhney, Co-Founder of healthtech startup Pristyn Care, shared her outlook on India’s fast-growing digital economy and the role tech will play in improving the healthcare sector in India, in a conversation with Miloni Bhatt, Editor - Digital Broadcast, EconomicTimes.com in the wake of ‘MAMA India - The Digital Bharat 2.0’ event. MAMA India, an initiative by global attribution and marketing analytics leader, AppsFlyer, aims to bring together top Indian startups, founders, product leaders, mobile marketing heads, and app developers for conversations and connections to help businesses tap the opportunities in India’s burgeoning mobile app economy.“While listening to customers, it is important to look at the behavioral data patterns, and really understand what the customers want and what their pain points are. And once you understand this, you'll also see what is the biggest problem and what is the size of the impact… And also, we should be open to learning and understand our mistakes. It's like launch, learn, iterate; all the three cycles should be continuously done to improve the product or features,” said Himavant Kurnala, Chief Product Officer - Marketplace, Reliance Retail.The panelists also shared insights on the key strategies companies must adopt to scale a category defining product, how to maintain consistency in communication and ensure differentiated customer experiences. From how to understand your product-market to the nuances of the constantly changing and evolving ecosystem of the Indian app development industry, the panelists also shed light on the different product-led growth strategies to keep in mind, including addressing the diversity agenda when building products and solutions. Decoding the cultural nuances brands must consider when building a product or business in India as well as the need for creating innovative solutions with a focus on diversity and inclusion were panelists Suchi Mukherjee, Founder & CEO, Limeroad.com, Poonam Bhatt, EVP - Digital, Vodafone Idea Ltd., and Rashmi Chadha, Founder of WoVoyage. In a roundtable discussion moderated by Ritu Sharma, Country Manager, India, AppsFlyer, on the topic ‘Destination India: Addressing the Diversity Agenda in Digital India,’ the panelists emphasized the importance of ensuring diversification in terms of user personas, not just in terms of geography, and identifying the right customer acquisition strategies to cater to the standards set by the Bharat user.“This Bharat user is a very, very tough user to please. They are tougher than you and me because the standards that they're setting. They’re raising the bar (by saying) ‘Saste me dho, badhiya dho’. And on top of that… ‘I am on Instagram; I know what Bella Hadid is wearing, I am that user’. So all of a sudden, I think in one line, Bharat has raised the bar. And it is a really, really tough bar. That's number one. And therefore the acquisition strategy for us is that now you acquire this really tough consumer,” said Mukherjee, summing up the challenges and the opportunities for the Indian app ecosystem in effectively catering to the needs of growing Tier 2 and 3 market users in the Indian app ecosystem.To know more about the MAMA India: The Digital Bharat 2.0 initiative and/or watch any of the sessions on demand, do visit the website.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

China’s manufacturing activity unexpectedly eased in March, a private survey showed, leading a slide in factory gauges across Asia as the global economic outlook darkened.China’s Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index — which covers mainly smaller and export-oriented businesses — eased slightly last month as new orders and output both declined, registering a 50 reading that’s exactly the line between expansion and contraction.The PMIs for factories across Asia showed a continued divergence between North and South in March. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all stayed in contraction territory while much of Southeast Asia’s factory outlooks remained in expansion, although at a slightly slower or little changed pace from the previous month, according to S&P Global on Monday. BloombergAsia’s export powerhouses are seeing subdued demand amid a global economic outlook beset by elevated inflation and borrowing costs and rising risks of recession. North Asian economies also are dealing with geopolitical risk and volatility in the semiconductor industry.In China, latest indicators show the post-reopening recovery is being led mainly by the non-manufacturing sectors, particularly consumer spending on services and a pickup in construction. The Caixin PMI index — which was lower than February’s 51.6 and the 51.4 median in a Bloomberg survey of economists — was also weaker than the official PMI for manufacturing, released on Friday. That index showed an expansion in manufacturing activity in March, although at a slightly slower pace than the previous month. The non-manufacturing index surged to the highest in more than a decade, the official data showed last week. What Bloomberg economics saysMarch’s bigger-than-expected drop in the Caixin manufacturing PMI reinforces our view that China’s recovery after the exit from Covid Zero remains patchy. The main drivers of growth — services spending and government investment — don’t appear to be boosting the smaller businesses and exporters tracked in the Caixin survey.The PMI reading indicated there were signs of a weakening in China’s rebound, Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said in the statement accompanying the release.“The foundation for economic recovery is not yet solid,” he said. “Only by working hard to stabilize employment, increase household income, and improve market expectations, can the government reach its goal of restoring and expanding consumption.”Japan’s PMI was at 49.2 in March from 47.7 in the previous month. South Korea slipped to 47.6 from 48.5, the worst since September. Taiwan’s factory gauge stayed in contraction territory — below 50 — in March, sliding to 48.6 from 49 the previous month, data showed Friday.There was a brighter outlook in Southeast Asia, where the region’s biggest economy, Indonesia, ticked up to 51.9 from 51.2, the best showing since September. Thailand and the Philippines eased slightly while staying in expansion. Vietnam slipped to 47.7 from 51.2 while Malaysia posted a slight contraction at 48.8.For Southeast Asia, “optimism across the region remained strongly upbeat, and with inflationary and supply chain pressures subsiding, this bodes well for the recovery of the sector,” said Maryam Baluch, an economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!

On the Member e-Sewa portal of EPFO, it is mentioned that these eligible employees have time till May 3, 2023, to submit application form along with other required documents for higher pension. Thus, one can say that EPFO has extended deadline to apply for higher pension under EPS. till May 3, 2023.Getty ImagesRelatedEPFO issues guidelines for higher pension from EPS: Know where, how to applyThere is good news for a certain category of Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) members. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has allowed certain eligible members to apply for higher pension under the EPS till May 3, 2023. Do note that the Supreme Court in its judgement dated November 4, 2022, had allowed 4 months to apply for a higher pension under EPS. Consequently, as per the SC order, the last date to apply for a higher pension under EPS was March 3, 2023. The window to apply for a higher pension till May 3, 2023, is only available to those employees who were members of EPF on September 1, 2014, and continued to be members of the EPF on or after September 1, 2014, but missed the opportunity to apply for higher pension before the expiry of earlier deadline. The employees who retired prior to September 1, 2014, and opted for higher pension under the pension scheme, made their contributions but their application, later on, was rejected by the EPFO must submit their application form on or before March 3, 2023. This is because no extension has been made for such employees. The circular for these employees was issued on December 29, 2022, and an online application form was issued in January 2023.Also Read: Why applying for higher EPS pension may be a golden opportunityPuneet Gupta, Tax Partner, People Advisory Services, EY India,""A welcome news from the EPFO - the deadline to file higher pension applications which was set by the Supreme Court in its Nov 2022 ruling as 3 March 2023 has been extended by the EPFO to 3 May 2023. This will give more time to employees to take an informed decision on whether or not to opt for higher pension - specifically given that the EPFO has issued guidelines only on 20 Feb 2023. Online link on the EPFO portal to file such higher pension applications have also been enabled. While filing such applications, one of the ask on the portal is to file copy of permission taken under Para 26(6) of the EPF Scheme through which approval is taken from the EPFO to make contributions to EPF on higher salary. Given that such permissions are practically not taken and it is standard practice to contribute to EPF basis full basic salary - such requirement to attach copy of permission under Para 26(6) of the EPF Scheme may be removed.""Anshul Prakash, Partner, Employment Labour & Benefits, Khaitan & Co says, ""Please note that the online portal to opt for higher pension benefits for employees who had retired from their services prior to 1 September 2014 (and had opted for higher pension benefits back then) was activated by EPFO in the month of January 2023. The said portal was activated pursuant to necessary directions and instructions for filing of applications by EPFO for the said category of employees. Owing to the time period already provided to the above category of employees to opt for higher pension benefits, there is no extension of time period for filing of applications for such employees and the last date to opt for higher pension benefits is 3 March 2023. The EPFO has extended the time period to 3 May 2023 only for employees who were members of the Employees’ Pension Scheme 1995 (‘EPS Scheme’) on 1 September 2014 and continued to be members of the EPS Scheme on or after 1 September 2014. No such extension has been specified for employees who had retired from their services prior to 1 September 2014 and had opted for higher pension benefits back then.""Why there was a need to extend the last date to apply for a higher pension under EPSThough it appears that EPFO has extended the deadline (for certain EPS members) to submit an application for the higher pension under EPS from March 3, 2023, to May 3, 2023, no circular/notification by the retirement fund body has been issued for the same till the time of publishing. The last date to submit application for higher pension under EPS is May 3, 2023 is mentioned on the EPFO's Member's e-Sewa portal. Earlier, the EPFO issued guidelines on the matter for eligible employees on February 20, 2023 - just 12 days before the expiry of the Supreme Court mandated deadline.Also Read: Eligible employees who missed higher EPS pension option earlier can still apply: Latest EPFO circularThere was a need for the extension of the deadline as employees wishing to apply needed time to collect various required documents to apply for the higher pension under the EPS. Further, there is no clarification regarding how much money they are required to pay or how much will be deducted from their Employees Provident Fund (EPF) corpus if they opt for a higher pension under EPS. EPFO itself, in its last circular (dated February 20, 2023) on the subject, had mentioned that further guidelines/clarifications would be issued but these are still awaited.PV Murthy, Head of labour practice, Economic Laws Practice - law firm says, ""The EPFO has opened its portal last night and as mentioned by ELP earlier, the time to exercise the option has been extended till May 3rd, 2023. The members need to look at this as an investment decision and each member needs to take such a decision basis life expectancy rate, the benefit they will get and the amount that needs to be paid back by them to EPFO.""Don’t miss out on ET Prime stories!
